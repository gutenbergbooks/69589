<p class='pindent'>Three years ago, <span class='it'>The Secret Victory</span> brought to an end
the trilogy which I called <span class='it'>The Sensationalists</span>. This book
and the antecedent volumes—<span class='it'>Lady Lilith</span> and <span class='it'>The Education
of Eric Lane</span>—described the fortunes of certain men
and women who constituted part of the larger groups which
I had approached in <span class='it'>Sonia, Midas and Son</span> and <span class='it'>Sonia
Married</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>By the accident of birth, fortune or talent, “these our
actors” were made to fill a position—before, during and
after the war—which attracted to them more attention than
was warranted by their historical importance. My defence—if
I must defend myself—is that the butterfly in every
age has claimed more notice than the bee. The social scene,
to change my metaphor, presented by so single-minded a
writer as Mr. Greville has to find room for the D’Orsays,
the Egremonts, the Sidney Smiths and the Madame de
Lievens, who throng his stage in act after act, as well as
for the Peels, Wellingtons and Melbournes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Is a defence still necessary for continuing the life of a
character from one novel to another? Mr. Disraeli, in his
splendid progress through a part of Mr. Greville’s period,
refused to cut the thread of an imaginary existence at the
moment when his last page was bound into its cover; and
the novel-sequence which aims to describe a social and political
scene must, no less than succeeding volumes of memoirs,
call back to the stage the same leaders and the same camp-followers.
If this present series have any artistic or historical
value, I should like it to be found in the completed
picture.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I attempted, in <span class='it'>Sonia</span>, to trace the adolescence of the
generation that grew to manhood in time to meet the shock
of the war. That war ends in the first line of the present
volume; and, before the last page, the government that was
charged to bring peace back to the sparse survivors has
itself passed away. One phase in history has been concluded;
and this series, which aimed at describing a single
English scene in the life of a single generation, ends with
the end of that phase.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I ask no one to share any regret which I may feel in
taking leave of characters that have been my constant companions
for more than eight years. If they are no more
likable than the men and women we meet in daily life, I
have at least never allowed parental affection to cover up
their shortcomings. I present them to you as a small mark
of a deep devotion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>The eleventh hour of the eleventh day of the eleventh
month</span> .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Though the departmental order was marked “secret”,
I did not hesitate to give my wife a hint of its contents.
All the world—if the armistice were accepted—could
read the news next morning. And the armistice would
be accepted. Silence hung over town and country
throughout the misty, long hours of Sunday: it was, I
felt, as though all England were at prayer. Faint restlessness
muttered throughout the lagging, cold hours of
Sunday night: it was as though all England were keeping
vigil.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You <span class='it'>can’t</span> doubt,” I told Barbara, as we parted at the
door of the Admiralty. “With any luck, the news is
waiting for me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I can’t <span class='it'>believe</span>,” she answered. “Four years and
three months. Nearly a fifth of my whole life. I’m used
to the war .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. almost. I don’t see why it should ever
stop.”</p>

<h3>2</h3>

<p class='pindent'>It was my turn for late duty; but, when I reached my
room, I found a message:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='pindent'>“Captain Hornbeck’s compliments; and it will not be
necessary for Commander Oakleigh to stay unless he
wishes.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Peace was not yet come, then, or Philip Hornbeck
would have told me; it would come that night, or he
would not have granted me leave of absence. The Admiralty,
meanwhile, could not have been more silent if
the old world had died in giving birth to the new.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You got my chit?,” Hornbeck asked in an undertone,
when I went to report. “Unless you <span class='it'>want</span> to hang about
here .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My taste for bureaucracy,” I answered, with a glance
of loathing at his “IN”, “OUT” and “PENDING”
trays, “has been cured.” How long did Barbara say the
war had lasted? Since 1914? Yes, four years and three
months had passed since I began to masquerade unconvincingly
as an officer of the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve.
With the actors, artists, barristers and stockbrokers
who combined to make up my section of the
intelligence department, I had talked a hundred times of
the day when we should have taken our last undeserved
salute and laid aside the latest of our comic-opera uniforms.
Now it was come. “As I’m here, I may as well
lend a hand. I suppose they’re bound to sign?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hornbeck unlocked a row of japanned boxes and
glanced perfunctorily at his secret files before plunging
them in the fire.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It won’t come through in time for the morning
papers, so I’m getting rid of the evidence before I’m told
not to,” he chuckled. “ ‘<span class='it'>The eleventh hour .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. of the</span>
<span class='it'>eleventh day .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. of the eleventh month.</span>’ Sounds as if
a journalist had had something to do with that!” One
file slipped to the floor; and I read on the faded docket
“<span class='it'>Goeben and Breslau, 1914</span>”. It had been a very long
war. “Lord! These papers are a satire on the vanity
of human wishes!,” he drawled. “You can give all your
people leave for the day. They won’t be in a fit state to
work .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. even if you had any work to give them. And
I suppose you won’t have. It .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. takes you some time
to grasp that it’s all over,” he added, checking half way
to the fire and staring bemusedly at the papers in his
hands. Looking at him, I needed time to recall that he
had been a young man when war broke out. “What are
you and Lady Barbara going to do with yourselves?,” he
asked after a pause.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Get away to the sun,” I answered with the grim determination
of a man whose vitality was spent for lack
of rest and good food.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Wonder .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. what will happen .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. to <span class='it'>us</span>,” Hornbeck
pondered, punctuating his words with abrupt shrieks
of rending paper. “No more wars; .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. no more navies
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. or armies.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, you of all men are entitled to a holiday,” I said.
Four years of Whitehall had made him short-sighted and
round-shouldered; his square, wooden face was pallid;
and his slow speech argued a tired brain.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Everything will seem a bit flat now,” muttered one of
the most powerful men in England, who within the next
few days or hours would be as inconsequential as myself.
Beyond a narrow circle described round the Treasury Exchange,
the name of Captain Hornbeck was unknown;
the weight and cunning of his hand, however, had been
felt for more than four years in Mexican revolutions,
Greek <span class='it'>coups d’état</span> and Russian counter-revolutions. The
papers which he was destroying ranged from reports on
South American credit-transfers to track-charts of North
Atlantic commerce-raiders. “This is what the N.O. has
been training for, ever since the old Britannia days,” he
went on. “Now that we’ve finished it .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Wiping the sweat from his forehead, he threw open the
window. From force of habit, he switched off the lights
before pulling up the blind; then, as the last night of the
war engulfed him in a grey eddy of fog, he laughed at
his own forgetfulness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There’s still a fair-sized mess to clean up,” I reminded
him, as he raked with irresolute fingers the memoranda
that constituted the Admiralty’s suggestions for
the peace conference.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah, I must leave that to you politicians,” he laughed.
“And I don’t envy you the job. A world without
war .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. It’s a thing we’ve never seen, George. And
when you consider that we’re all of us demoralized and
most of us bankrupt .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I suppose friend Woodrow
knows what he wants, but I don’t believe any one else
does.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Doctor feller once told me that, when a
baby’s born, it comes into the world with its fists clenched.
I sometimes wonder if war isn’t a natural instinct.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Self-preservation is the first natural instinct,” I answered;
“but it’s not consistent with modern methods of
fighting.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I know. This war will be a friendly scrap by
comparison with the next.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s stopping,” I said, “just when we were beginning
to learn something of mass-production, mass-enlistment,
mass-mobilization of resources, mass-destruction.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hornbeck strolled to a vast wall-map of the world and
stared at it, with his hands dug deep into his pockets.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In the next war, we shan’t attempt to distinguish between
combatants and non-combatants,” he predicted.
“The air-raids and the blockade have caught the civilian.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And no country will be allowed to remain neutral,” I
added, “any more than Luxemburg and Greece in this
war.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Until, at the end, when the human population of the
earth has been destroyed with typhoid-germs and poison-gas,
you’ll be left with two submersible flying-tanks chasing
each other among the ice of the North Pole.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He stirred the fire to a blaze and began once more to
feed it with the papers from his private safe. I might
have helped him; but this news of approaching peace
seemed to relax all my muscles. For the first time in
more than four years I could look beyond the work of
the moment and see myself as an individual. When I
was less tired, I could go back to the old life; and, for a
man with a competence, life in England had been more
than tolerable until the fourth of August, 1914.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t let’s talk about the <span class='it'>next</span> war,” I said. “Unless
we can find a substitute .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“People talked like that after Waterloo,” Hornbeck
murmured.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I expect they talked like that after the siege of Troy;
but they always sowed their peace with the seeds of the
next war.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The night air was chilling the room; and Hornbeck
interrupted his task of destruction to shut the window.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, what kind of peace do you want now?,” he
asked, with a smile half mocking, half wistful playing
over his tired face. “This war followed inevitably on
the war of ’70, which followed inevitably on the nationalist
wars, which followed inevitably on Napoleon’s conquests.
Will you divide the world now according to
nationalities? I’m afraid you’ll have new wars in Poland,
Alsace-Lorraine, Austria, Turkey; not to mention Egypt
and India. People talk about a United States of the
World; but, when you’ve been getting the last ounce out
of national spirit for all these years, you won’t persuade
white men to take their orders from an international
committee of dagos.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I turned from the wall-map to the official estimates of
casualties in all countries.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“When people remember what a bloody business war
is .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.” I began.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We had South Africa and Japan to warn <span class='it'>us</span>!” he
interrupted. “The next generation .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. George, I
promise you that, unless you get your new heaven and
your new earth functioning at once, you’ll drift back to
the only kind of life a nation knows. Fear and arrogance;
insane hatred and colossal stupidity. Periodically
the world will panic into war, which is the only final solution
known to history.” .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The only one we’ve tried; and it’s a solution of nothing,”
I answered. “My God, if I didn’t believe this was
really a war to end war .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I paused as Hornbeck was called to the telephone. He
listened for a moment, nodded to me and took down his
coat and cap. Even he could work no longer; and, as I
walked home alone, I tried to understand that the “war
to end war” had itself ended. In four years I had forgotten
how London looked before the lamps were
shrouded and the hoardings placarded with patriotic appeals.
Their purpose was accomplished; a uniform would
soon be as rare as civilian clothes were now; the hospitals
would empty; the blue coats and red ties of the
convalescents would disappear.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The city was very silent; but at eleven o’clock, I imagined,
there would be such a silence as would make men
think that the earth was halting in her course. Out there,
over the water, some would adventure amicably into the
enemy’s lines; some would drift back to their base; most
would wait dumbly for orders; and one man would be
the last to die in the Great War.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At the top of Waterloo Place I found a policeman flashing
his lantern on the doors and shutters of the shops.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think you’d like to know that the Germans have
accepted the armistice,” I said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thank you, sir,” he answered with a salute.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A taxi crawled westward across Piccadilly Circus; and
I told the driver.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They ’ave, ’ave they?,” he muttered in perplexity.
“Oh, they <span class='it'>’ave</span>.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Well .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I hesitated long before reckoning the number of those
for whom peace came too late. In ’14 my generation was
of an age to be called for the hottest and the longest of
the fighting. Sam Dainton had escaped with a flesh
wound, Jack Waring with a split head and a broken
nerve, David O’Rane with the loss of his sight; these,
with the five or six who had failed to pass the doctors
or had been tied to a mission abroad, were all
that remained of the friends who had said good-bye
to their schools in the last years of the nineteenth
century.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A lifetime had passed since we all talked of what we
would do “on the day peace is signed”; and yet, when
we spoke of “last summer”, we always meant “the summer
before the war”. It was, at the same time, an
eternity and an episode.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So,” I reflected at the door of my house in Seymour
Street, “one school of political thought in France looked
upon the Revolution and the Empire.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>From force of habit, I headed for the hot milk in my
dressing-room and rang to have my bath prepared. Then
I recollected that I need never again work by night and
sleep by day.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll breakfast first,” I told Barbara’s maid. “And I
shan’t go to bed this morning. The armistice has been
signed.” The girl tried to speak, but could only turn
away with a sob that sounded like “dad”. “Has her
ladyship been called?,” I asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Still unable to speak, the girl shook her head and
nodded in the direction of a breakfast-tray.</p>

<h3>3</h3>

<p class='pindent'>Barbara was asleep, with a light burning by her side
and an open book face-downwards on the bed. At last,
I told myself, I could see something of my wife. I should
be able to read the new poets and novelists who overflowed
her cases. At last we could entertain our friends
again. At last, after eight months, we could have our
honeymoon. Barbara looked dangerously fragile. As I
watched her, one hand was drawn slowly up the sheet;
and the fingers were almost transparent. Her head turned
restlessly from side to side; and I knew that she was
dreaming. There was a whispered sigh; and I felt that
her dreams were unhappy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“George! Oh, it’s you!,” she exclaimed with a throb
of relief; and, as she brushed the cloudy hair back from
her face, I saw that her big, deep-set eyes were black
and anguished.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Who else should it be?,” I asked, as I draped a shawl
over her thin shoulders and kissed her flushed cheeks.
“They’ve signed, Babs. It’s all over.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. all .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. over?,” she repeated dreamily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes. I telephoned to your mother from the Admiralty.
They’re safe: Neave and Charlie.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Silence fell between us until Barbara covered her face
and murmured: “Thank God!” Then she sat up and
stared round the shadowy room:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. what are we going to do now?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Within an hour I felt that most people would be asking
themselves that question:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t know. For this morning Phil Hornbeck suggested
that I should invite a few friends to my room in
case there’s anything to see. Afterwards .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Afterwards you must take me away!,” she cried.
“You’re quite sure there’s been no mistake?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Quite sure!,” I answered, as I sat down by the telephone
and tried to remember which of our friends we
should both care to have with us at the moment when
peace dawned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A change had overtaken London by the time that I set
out to collect my party. As on August bank-holiday four
years earlier, when I drove about Gloucestershire, with
Loring and O’Rane, waiting for news, the city had an air
of suspended animation. Of the twenty strangers who
interrogated me on my way across the park, not one had
more doubt that the terms would be accepted than that
the sun would rise on the morrow. And yet, so nicely
balanced were hope and fear, I should have been surprised
if any one had laid me long odds on peace. Like
Barbara, they were grown used to the war. As I spread
the news from house to house, every one said: ‘What
time is it now?’; and it seemed as if the eleventh hour
of the eleventh day would never come. There was a
muddle-headed point of honour, too, that no one should
betray even impatience.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, yes, I’ll look in, if I have nothing better to do.
You might have called here instead of bringing me to
this infernal contraption,” growled my uncle Bertrand,
who always visited his hatred of the telephone on the
heads of those who addressed him by it. “That all you
have to say? Filson! Filson!,” I heard him calling to
his man. “They’ve signed!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Lady Dainton, whom I invited for the sake of old associations,
murmured: “Thank you so much. I know
Roger will be interested,” as though I had announced a
minor change in the cabinet. Raymond Stornaway said:
“I trust this doesn’t mean a general holiday: I’ve the very
devil of a day’s work ahead of me.” My sister Beryl
hoped that I had not gone to the expense of buying that
new uniform.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I had already warned old Lady Loring by telephone;
and, when I reached Curzon Street, I found my cousin
Violet dressed to go out and playing in the hall with her
boy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m waiting to be told what to do next,” was her
greeting.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Though she had worn her deep mourning for more
than three years, her little white face looked pathetically
young and helpless. I wondered what kind of life she
could expect from the armistice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’re all in the same boat,” I answered. “I called
to suggest that you should bring Sandy to the Admiralty.
My father could just remember the Famine; my mother
remembers the crowds in the streets when Sebastopol fell.
Sandy may carry away something to fix this, eighty years
hence, as the day when the Great War ended.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wonder if people will talk about it then as ‘the
Great War’?,” Violet mused.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As she buttoned her boy into his coat, I felt that she
was thinking only of the day when her husband of a
month, with all that health, fortune, rank and riches could
give him, drifted whimsically to France, in the meshes
of a machine which he ridiculed, there to die in defence
of one country, which he faintly despised, against another,
which he mildly disliked. Violet had been left
with a son to bring up and a vast estate to administer.
She would never, I knew, marry again; and, now that
the war was over, she saw herself fading into the twilight
of life to dwell with ghosts and memories and
dreams.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The Great Waste,” I suggested, as we set out. “If
any one could have foreseen, four years ago, how this
would end, I wonder if there’d have been a war? I tremble
to think what the world will look like when we have
time to take stock.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>In our passage from Loring House to the Admiralty, I
found that the news had spread before us; and young
Lucien de Grammont, speeding towards the French Embassy,
stopped long enough to vent on us his disappointment
that the allies had not insisted on unconditional
surrender.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Those accursed Americans!,” he cried. “But for
them, peace would have been signed in Berlin! Now in
fifty years’ time .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Well, let us hope we shan’t be
alive to see it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>As he flung off in furious disappointment, I ventured
the opinion that, but for the Americans, a German peace
might have been dictated in Paris. Then we pressed
through the crowd in the Processional Avenue and took
up our positions to see at least the greatest war in history
ending. My secretary had cleared the table of its trays;
and we sat in a row, looking through the mist of Horse
Guards’ Parade and trying to guess what was going to
happen. The Crawleighs had arrived before us and were
talking to Raymond Stornaway; Sir Roger and Lady
Dainton followed on our heels; and our last inch of space
was filled when my uncle Bertrand, puffing and growling
at the stairs, lumbered in with heavy tread and demanded
in the loud voice of incipient deafness why it was necessary
to collect this nest of magpies.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Disreputable old wrecks we are!,” he muttered with a
glance of sour and comprehensive disfavour from Lord
Crawleigh to Sir Roger Dainton and from Sir Roger
Dainton to Raymond Stornaway. The grey November
light, shining on a row of bent backs and haggard faces,
made us older than our years. “We’ve <span class='it'>had</span> our chance,”
he continued; “I believe the only way of stopping war is
to have conscription for all men and women over fifty
and to call up the oldest classes first.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So that you could hear men of thirty boasting that
they’d ‘given’ two grandfathers to the army?,” asked
Raymond.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They’d still be of an age to be kicked, if they tried
that kind of cant.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. No, but I’m sufficiently sick of
everything to feel it’s indecent for me to be alive when
mere children are wearing black for men who might have
been my grandsons. Eighty-four.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Most of my
friends will tell you I’ve lived twenty years too long;
and, on my soul, I believe they’re right.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You said something of the kind on the day war broke
out,” I reminded him. “Now that it’s all over .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bertrand gathered himself for attack, towering over me
with his hands on his hips till the silence of the room
daunted him. Then he shrugged his shoulders and
turned, with a savage tug at his black walrus-moustache,
to shake hands with his neighbours:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t detect any great reason for optimism. Um,
Crawleigh. You English have seen a million or two of
your best men killed or wounded.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Whose child is
that? .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. You’ve seen new debt piled up to the tune
of thousands of millions.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. How do, Lady Crawleigh?
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I’m an Irishman.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Violet, my dear!
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. And a liberal. I’ve seen liberalism stamped out of
existence and the Irish party broken.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Lady Dainton,
your humble servant. Find me a seat, George, there’s
a good boy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Most of us knew my uncle well enough to imagine his
violent anger if any one else had dared to be so despondent.
My father-in-law, however, felt obliged to pick up
the gage.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You mean that we should be no worse off,” he suggested,
“if the Germans had drawn up the terms and we
had accepted them?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not quite,” Bertrand conceded, “not quite.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I
beg your pardon, Barbara my dear, I didn’t see you! .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
If you know your Bible, my dear Crawleigh, you’ll recollect
that a Jew called Samson tried to get level with the
Philistines by pulling a heavy roof down on their heads.
He got level; but he paid for it with his life. Some one
pulled away the pillars that had been holding up our
civilization for Heaven knows how many centuries.
Credit, commerce, law and order, faith and morals, production,
exchange, distribution: they’ve all toppled; and
they’ve toppled on the heads of <span class='it'>all</span> of us. You’ll see as
soon as peace really sets in. No! No, Crawleigh! This
war should have ended two years ago, while there were
still a few tiles left on the roof!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I recalled my uncle’s warning, on the day war broke
out, that freedom of speech was dead; on the day it
ended, he asserted his right to it with a truculence that
had been shouted down when he pleaded for “a
patched-up peace” at the end of 1916, before the United
States came in, and again in 1917 when the Lansdowne
letter was published.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Lucien de Grammont wants to go on to Berlin,” I
said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bertrand clasped his hands over the crook of his stick
and nodded scornfully at a headstrong world that refused
to take his advice. His expression and attitude reminded
me of Dr. Johnson, in the celebrated picture, awaiting an
audience with Lord Chesterfield.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He forgets, perhaps, that we at least went into this
war to uphold the neutrality of Belgium. We stayed in
to make the Germans pay for the damage they’d done
there. Later .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Later, we were told that the French
must have Alsace-Lorraine, Russia must have Constantinople,
Italy must have an infernal place called the Trentino.
And any stray islands or continents where a German
or the ally of a German has ever set foot must be
taken away and given to somebody else. It may be all
very right and proper; but that wasn’t our aim in 1914.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>More was coming; but his audience began to shew
signs of hostility; and Violet intervened by setting her
boy on the old man’s knee and whispering:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You mustn’t quarrel on a day like this. Help me to
shew him the different nationalities, Uncle Bertrand.
Sandy! Sandy! You see the little man down there by
the tree. D’you know what he is? He’s a Jap. Japanese.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Jap-an-ese,” Sandy repeated slowly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Those are Americans,” she continued, with her finger
pointing to three grave, lean-faced young officers. “Amer-i-cans.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Call ’em ‘Yanks’, most noble marquess,” grunted
Bertrand, who—with much else that was Johnsonian—exhibited
the doctor’s unreasoning antipathy to the new
world.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Merry-cans,” Sandy repeated.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There’s a Frenchman! There’s a Canadian! See,
Sandy? Uncle Bertrand, find me an Italian,” Violet
pleaded. “I don’t know how much this mite will remember,
but it is rather marvellous to see them all together.
That’s a South African, isn’t it? Oh, and a poor
soul with only one leg. There’ll still be plenty of them
for him to see when he’s grown up. I <span class='it'>wish</span> I could find
an Italian!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The open space under my window had filled so rapidly
that it was hardly possible for any one to move. Typists
from the government offices, in short skirts and transparent
blouses, were standing on tiptoe, bare-headed in
the biting cold, staring bright-eyed over the shoulders of
those in front. There were soldiers, in uniform and in
their hospital undress; sailors; nurses; government messengers
with battered red boxes; a park-keeper; two
clergymen; some errand-boys; and a thousand nondescripts.
At one moment they were very silent; at another,
they broke into feverish conversation with unknown
neighbours, occasionally shaking hands and cheering
a foreign uniform.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Five minutes to eleven,” muttered a voice which I
could not identify.</p>

<h3>4</h3>

<p class='pindent'>The emotions of the crowd were reacting on us. Behind
me, I could hear murmurs like the soughing of wind,
rising and falling with the murmurs of the crowd. When
hands were excitedly shaken below us, I felt Barbara’s
fingers gripping my wrist and saw Violet bending to kiss
the silken curls of her child’s head.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Out there, over the water, the ‘cease-fire’ must be
travelling down the unending shambles of the two opposing
lines. The shadow that had darkened the world for
more than four years had at last been driven away; and
no one was going to be mutilated or killed any more. All—more
than all—that we set out to do in 1914 had
been accomplished; and the bound heads and empty
sleeves of the survivors, the black dresses of those with
no survivors to welcome, testified to the cost. Of the uniforms
below us, some had first been donned in Tasmania,
some in Natal, others on the Alaskan border. Belgium
and Servia, Russia and France, Portugal and Japan, Italy
and Rumania: all had joined hands with our English-speaking
peoples to hem in the wild beast. Throughout
the night, the news had crackled from Poldhu to the
Azores, from Arlington to Seattle, that the wild beast
was subdued. It had flashed to lonely patrols through
the frost of the North Sea and the fire of the Persian
Gulf; two hundred million men were now standing silent,
with their eyes on their watches; and I fancied again the
unearthly hush that must drop on the world when the last
war ended.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In spite of Bertrand, in spite of Lucien de Grammont,
in spite of Hornbeck I believed that it was the last war.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>Burp! .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Burp! .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Burp!</span> The maroons were
like the rending of colossal drums. <span class='it'>Burp! .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
Burp! .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Burp!</span> Sandy turned wide eyes of alarm
upon us and buried his face in Violet’s bosom. <span class='it'>Burp!
Burp! Burp!</span></p>

<p class='pindent'>“Eleven o’clock,” muttered Roger Dainton in a quavering
voice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>My secretary collapsed into a chair, murmuring “Air-raid”;
and, though I knew that air-raids had now passed
into history, I imagined for a moment that the last ‘scrap
of paper’ had followed the first and that London and
Paris were to be laid in ruins.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>Burp! .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Burp! Burp!</span></p>

<p class='pindent'>There was no concerted cheering from the crowd
below; but I had a curious feeling that the next man
but one, down all that line from the Admiralty Arch to
Buckingham Palace, had opened his lips and was waiting
for a neighbour to cheer with him. Heads were turning
in every direction; eyes were gazing upward, as though
they expected to see “Peace” written across the sky in
letters of flame; bodies, for a moment, were very still.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then that vast sea of men and women gathered itself
up and poured with a hoarse roar towards the Palace.
There was a check, and I fancy the first-comers must
have been pressed against the railings; I threw open my
window in time to hear a mutter rolling from lip to lip:
“The king! They’re calling for the king.” Later,
though we could see and hear nothing of it, the word
was passed: “The king! He’s speaking”; later still:
“He’s finished! Give him a cheer! Hip, hip! <span class='it'>Come
on.</span>”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The human sea must have eddied at the Palace. Five
minutes later, as the crowd below my window surged
forward, a returning stream poured down the Processional
Avenue into Trafalgar Square; and a new current
set in towards the Abbey. There was little cheering now,
though every one made individual noises of greeting and
laughter. A War Office car hooted its deliberate way
across Horse Guards’ Parade and was promptly seized
by three wounded soldiers and four girl-clerks, who
ranged themselves along the running-boards and perched
on the bonnet. As though all had been awaiting a signal,
the crowd broke into little groups and swept like swarming
bees upon every vehicle in sight. So long as all could
move, it did not matter whither they hurried: something,
all seemed to feel, must be happening somewhere else.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The war’s over!,” some one cried; and mechanically,
like hysterical children, a dozen others repeated uncomprehendingly:
“The war’s over! The war’s over! The
war’s over! The war’s over.” .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And the funny thing,” said Raymond Stornaway,
blowing his nose vigorously, “is that they don’t know
what to do next.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do <span class='it'>we</span>?,” asked Bertrand; and, for once, he seemed
less anxious to instruct than to be instructed.</p>

<h3>5</h3>

<p class='pindent'>No one wanted to speak first. No one wanted to
move. No one cared to look any one else in the eyes.
Lady Crawleigh, I think, was the first to recover; and
she was slipping out of the room, with a twisted smile,
when Raymond put his back to the door and took the
position in hand with a general invitation to lunch with
him at the Carlton.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No speeches or ‘celebrations’,” he promised. “If
you’ll fight your way there as best you can, I’ll telephone
for a table.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>With the exception of Violet, we were glad to have
our minds made up for us. Bertrand was right: we none
of us knew what to do next. The movements of the
crowd had become rhythmical by the time that we set
out. Every cab and bus was loaded with excited clusters
of men and women who seemed ready to do anything
but remain still. Boys with paper caps and empty tins
marched aimlessly at the head of irregular battalions;
overwrought girls and grave grey-beards tramped with
arms linked, sublimely unselfconscious. The streets were
carpeted with torn paper. An indistinguishable hum of
voices floated over and about us, still seeming—as before—to
come from our next neighbour but one; and
on every face was written vague relief, vague good-will,
dawning disappointment and vast perplexity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘They order this matter, I said, better in France’,”
quoted Raymond, as we drifted slowly through the crowd
to kill time before luncheon. “The English don’t know
how to express their emotions.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They haven’t had much time yet to think what their
emotions are,” I reminded him. “What’s the next stage?
Babs and I are going off to the Riviera as soon as we
can. But after that?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>My</span> work will go on,” Raymond murmured with a
rueful glance down Pall Mall. We were within sight of
the unwieldy mansion from whose roof young Deryk
Lancing fell or flung himself on the eve of the war. The
estate, I believe, was valued at about twenty-five million
pounds sterling; and a freakish will had laid upon
Raymond’s shoulders the task of distributing a fortune
which Deryk himself could not control nor keep from
increasing. “You can come and help me, if you like,
George.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thanks, I’ve done the last day’s work of my life,” I
answered; “but I’ve lived so long at other people’s orders
that I’ve forgotten how to take a holiday.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The rest of our party was awaiting us by the door of
the restaurant; and throughout the meal we talked, for
talking’s sake, of the fourteen points and the probable
terms of peace. Though we had all accepted Raymond’s
invitation with relief, we were more sincerely relieved
when luncheon came to an end. We wanted to think;
and, when I had written a formal request for immediate
demobilization, I took Barbara home. The streets were
emptying as the silent crowds began to feel that they
could not for ever tramp to and fro or steal aimless rides.
Hunger was driving them in search of food; and the sunless
November afternoon, already touched with frost, was
mottling their white faces and chapped hands.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I feel .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. dazed,” Barbara signed, as we got into a
taxi with her parents.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We all do,” answered Lady Crawleigh.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As we drove away, I watched our party scattering.
From their silence I judged the Crawleighs were trying
to realize that their two elder boys were safe at last; the
Daintons, walking close together with bent heads, were
no doubt thinking of the son who would not return. As
my uncle’s big, lonely figure disappeared from sight, I
fancied that he might indeed be feeling he had lived too
long. William the Fourth had completed half his reign
when Bertrand was born: a man who had survived the
nineteenth century, the Victorian era and the greatest
war in history might well shrink aghast from the unknown
future.</p>

<h3>6</h3>

<p class='pindent'>At Barbara’s thoughts I could make no guess. Before
the war, she had been more mercilessly pursued by publicity
than any one of her generation. When our engagement
was announced, I slunk like a criminal past the contents-bills
that proclaimed a “<span class='it'>Famous Society Beauty
Engaged</span>”; and, on the day of the wedding, when the
traffic was held up for three hours and the auxiliary
police were numbered by hundreds, the London crowd
was certainly far more concerned to catch a glimpse of
Lady Barbara Neave than to hear that the Channel ports
were safe. Since our marriage, she had hardly appeared
in public; but, as she crouched over the fire without speaking,
I wondered what picture she was composing for her
life in the unknown, new peace.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When her maid came to dress her, I went to my own
room. Night had fallen silently; and, when I looked
towards the corner of Park Lane, the streets were more
empty than on the night of an air-raid. Once or twice
I heard the echo of subdued revelry; but, in ten minutes,
I counted only four men and two women walking rapidly
westward, closely buttoned against the biting air. Any
vision of what this day would be had nothing in common
with the patchwork I had seen. Dawdling luxuriously—for
the first time in four years—over my dressing, I
could recall scraps of altercation with Bertrand, flashes
of speculation with Hornbeck, confidences with Crawleigh.
Jerkiness, incompleteness, artificial reserve, an
overwhelming perplexity and a relief too great to be
expressed were what I carried away from the armistice;
and I should think that most people in England experienced
the same confused emotions and lay down that
night with the same confused recollections.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was none of the vulgar debauchery that had disgraced
the capital of a great empire on Mafeking night:
in nineteen years our pride was more chastened and our
thankfulness more heartfelt, even if we did not know
how to give it words.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I thought you promised to arrange a survivors’ dinner,”
said Barbara, as we went up to bed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Only about six of us survived,” I answered. “And
we’re all scattered. We’re tired, too. The war went on
too long.” Though I was almost too exhausted to think,
I remembered a far-away debate at Melton on the first
anniversary of the war, when the greatest headmaster
and the wisest man that I have met warned me that a
long war would be followed by an even longer moral
reaction: a bruised world, said old Burgess, would go
back to the ways it knew and to the fleshpots it loved.
“We shall be useless for years,” I said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wonder if it was worth it,” Barbara mused.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That depends on what you expected or wanted.
We’ve secured our terms. And, if it’s not too rhetorical,
I believe that every man who voluntarily offered his life,
at a time when we thought we were degenerating, has to
a great extent saved his soul. This country has been
spared invasion.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Barbara parted the curtains in her room and looked
down on the silent street.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The first night of peace since Jim’s last party at
Loring Castle,” she murmured. “We .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Well, I
suppose we go on from that?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If we want to.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, don’t you? For the last four years we haven’t
been able to call our souls our own.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wonder whether we ever shall again,” I said, as I
filled my final pipe. That last night of peace lingered
more vividly in my memory than any since. War was
certain. We had read Grey’s speech; and I walked with
O’Rane up and down the valley-terrace, trying to decide
what we were fighting to preserve. “We want something
more than the <span class='it'>status quo</span>,” I told Barbara. “That
night .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. There was no question, then, of a general
levy: the war must be over in a few months, and only
the regular army would fight. Well, we’d seen Jack Summertown
and a car-load of officers driving off the night
before: they were a small minority who were quite clearly
going to risk their skins for the rest of us. Were we
worth it? I told Raney that I’d like to shew something
that was better worth fighting for.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And haven’t we? When you think how every one
has worked and fought .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But now that it’s all over?,” I persisted. “Raney
said that people couldn’t come back from the war to take
up the old futility; you couldn’t set up social barriers between
men who had undertaken the same charge. It was
unthinkable to save a country from invasion in order to
perpetuate things like sweated labour. I wonder.” .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What a long time ago it all seems!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was no cynicism in Barbara’s voice; but, if anybody
spoke nowadays of a new world, his words were
dismissed as Fleet Street rhetoric or Downing Street claptrap;
and, though not one man of all the thousands who
would be returning in the next few days was likely to
say that he had risked his life to perpetuate sweated
labour, I could not imagine that many would exert themselves
to abolish it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Exertion! I was too tired to undress! The world
might be bankrupt and yet survive; the world might be
decimated and yet make good its wastage; first and foremost,
the world was weary to the marrow of its bones.</p>

<h3>1</h3>

<p class='pindent'>When we set out for Cannes three days after my
demobilization, I intended to remain out of England for
at least a twelvemonth. Since the night when Hornbeck
and I waited for news of the armistice I had thought
many times of his blank and puzzled confession: ‘<span class='it'>This
is what the N.O. has been training for, ever since the old
Britannia days.</span>’ If I had not also been preparing for
the peace and for the war which preceded it, I had at
least toiled for the whole of my adult life to preserve the
peace which preceded the war. Now I could have
adapted Hornbeck’s reasoning of ‘<span class='it'>no more wars, no more
armies and navies</span>’ to my own case; and, when my friends
asked me what I was going to do now, I might have said:
‘No more wars, no more politics or journalism on the
old lines.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>And this, I take it, was the attitude of all who had even
a smattering of modern history. From the moment when
I warned Barbara that we should perhaps never again be
able to call our souls our own, I realized that the armistice
had ended nothing but the long business of killing. The
victors would now contend for the fruits of their victory,
as Russians, Prussians and British had contended in the
Congress of Vienna; the vanquished would struggle to
preserve in defeat all that compassion, adroitness and
obstinacy could secure them, as Talleyrand had struggled
for France after Waterloo. The alliance, if it was like
any other of modern times, would be strained and perhaps
broken in the first weeks of peace, as after our wars
with Louis XIV and Napoleon. We should hear men
speaking, as de Grammont and Hornbeck already spoke,
of “the next war”. Any one who was concerned to
avert that must be prepared for a continued effort in
which he might truly be unable to call his soul his own.</p>

<h3>2</h3>

<p class='pindent'>Such energy or ability as I possess were ready to be
thrown into the common stock. I had told Philip Hornbeck
that the war would have been fought to no purpose
if we failed to discover a means of preventing future
wars. My difficulty was to know where my own very
moderate ability and energy were to be applied. The
leading articles and public speeches of these days, taking
their time from President Wilson, were familiarizing the
idea of a league of nations. Neither speech nor article,
however, made clear how the league could be helped to
birth by the good-will of insignificant, isolated individuals.
I debated with Bertrand whether I should stand
again for parliament; but my radicalism from 1906 to
1910 was too strong for the taste of Frank Jellaby and
the other liberal whips; it would be repugnant now to
every section of an assembly that had sunk party divisions
and was aiming at an agreed peace. Very much as Bishop
Blougram counselled Gigadibs to “overhaul theology”,
my uncle suggested sardonically that I should examine
the creeds which I had been professing for the last quarter
of a century and see how much of them the war had
left. He did not, however, urge my returning to the
House; and, if the outbreak of war had justified him in
discontinuing our propaganda in <span class='it'>Peace</span>, the end of the
war was hardly the occasion for resurrecting it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m more completely out of a job than any of you,”
I told Hornbeck when my old colleagues at the Admiralty
entertained me to a farewell dinner on my last night in
England. “An obsolete political editor .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Lucky man!,” he sighed enviously. “I’ve been
warned for duty when the peace conference opens. And,
after that, I’m to convert the intelligence department
here to peace uses. Beating swords into plough-shares;
and what not.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If I thought I could be of any use to you .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.,” I
began, with temperate enthusiasm; but Hornbeck shook
his head and nodded meaningly towards the men at the
far end of the table.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve already more than I know what to do with,”
he murmured ruefully. “<span class='it'>You</span> don’t <span class='it'>need</span> a job, but most
of these fellows do; and it’ll be harder for them to find
one than for you. The war was the opportunity of a
lifetime for most of them; but when it’s a question of
conventional, peace-time billets .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hornbeck shrugged his shoulders and looked with
mingled pride and amusement at the flock which he had
collected. There were men and women, married and
single, old and young; drawn from a dozen different professions,
they were alike in nothing but their admitted
ignorance of civil-service ways. And, in the hands of
Hornbeck, this ignorance had been converted into an asset.
As the department is dead, I can praise it—without
offence—for loyalty, hard work and efficiency such as I
have never seen excelled; without offence, too, I hope, I
can say that we were the strangest collection of government
officials that one man ever assembled below one roof.
The war, if it did nothing else, gave scope to our versatility.
At this dinner I recollect that Bellamy, the
actor, sat next to Clayton, the paper-manufacturer. On
his other side was Whitburn, the chancery silk; and, beyond
him, old Norton, the banker. Next to him sat my
private slave and fact-finder, Spence-Atkins, who had
reached manhood as a traveller in Manchester goods and,
on being discharged for neglect of business, had drifted
about the world, collecting figures and languages. Next
to him, again, was Jefferson Wright, who began the war
as a mathematical coach, lost a hand at Neuve Chapelle,
formed the statistical branch of the Purchase-and-Supply
Department, seconded himself to the Admiralty and ended
mysteriously as a brigadier on the pay-roll of the Ministry
of Labour.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It takes all kinds to make an intelligence department,”
I said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wish I could find something for them to do now,”
answered Hornbeck; and I remember his words as the
first hint of the human dislocation that would come as the
country declared itself in a state of peace.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the meantime, our conversation at this dinner
strengthened my feeling that I could do no good by remaining
in England at present; and I had excellent private
reasons for wishing to go abroad and to keep my
wife abroad. Until conditions were normal, we did not
even know where to live. Most of my income was derived
from Ireland: sentiment and duty required that I
should spend part of my time there as soon as the country
was habitable; and, now that my sister was married and
my mother had made her home in the south of France,
Barbara might well grasp at the chance of escaping from
England.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Quite deliberately, I feel as if I never wanted to go
back,” she announced next day, as we watched the white
cliffs of Dover fading from view.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But London, without you, would simply not be London!,”
said Lucien de Grammont, who was taking us
to stay with him at his father’s house by the Etoile.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It will perhaps be better for London, certainly better
for me, if we both make a fresh start,” she answered.
“I’m rather tired of it all.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of London in war? Naturally!,” Lucien persisted.
“And for the first months after the war, when we look
for the familiar faces and have to tell ourselves that they
will not come back .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Later on .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Later on, we must see how we feel,” I said; and the
conversation swung on to a less dangerous tack.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Though we never discussed her adventures in the days
before our marriage, I felt that Barbara was thinking
less of the familiar faces, which she would not see again,
than of those which would inevitably reappear in London
when each man returned to his own place. Among our
distressingly free-spoken friends it was commonly reported
that she was half engaged at the beginning of the
war to young Jack Waring; and, though she never pretended
to be in love with him, the engagement—according
to the Crawleighs—kept her from marrying Eric
Lane, with whom she was in love beyond all shadow of
doubt. Jack was in England looking for work. Eric
had been lecturing and travelling in America and Japan;
he would be coming to England as soon as he had a new
play to produce. I did not want Barbara to be reminded,
I did not want to be reminded myself, that she only married
me when Eric vanished from her world.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We want to begin our married life in some place with
no associations,” she went on, half to herself. Then, as
though to protest that she was not thinking of Eric, she
looked up with a smile and took my arm. “George and
I have had no honeymoon yet; and my beloved parents
didn’t make things very comfortable for us when I married
without a dispensation. Perhaps they’ll be more
reconciled if we give them a holiday.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. How soon
will peace be signed?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That depends how soon the conference opens,”
Lucien answered with a shrug. “You are to have your
general election first; and we .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. you will not find we
are in any hurry. There are nearly five lost years to
make up. France too is tired.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The lost years were being recovered when we reached
Paris in the last days of November. We had seen the
war ending in London; here we watched it being buried.
Every one who could get a passport and a ticket seemed,
like us, to be heading for the Riviera and spending a week
in Paris on the way. Every one, too, seemed to share
our vagueness and indifference to what lay ahead of this
holiday. For the first time in four years, our time was
our own; for the first time in four years Paris could
dine and dance without fear of being bombed or shelled.
Barbara bought frocks; Lucien arranged parties; and I
added the hall of the Ritz to the brief list—headed by
Port Said and Charing Cross—of the places where a
man, without waiting unduly long, can be sure of meeting
every one who has ever crossed his path before.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I doubt if in any other single week I have eaten so
many meals or spent so much money. From time to time
Lucien grumbled half-heartedly at all this waste of time:
he had been recalled from the embassy in London to assist
in drafting the agenda for the conference, and I felt
he owed a grumble to his conscience. For myself, I
blessed every hour of delay that enabled us to shed the
memories of the last five years and to forget the acerbities
of the last five months. Lucien had long been an
old enough friend to drop his diplomatic reserve in talking
to me; and there were times, before and after the
expeditions to Gallipoli and Salonica, before and after
the United States entered the war, before and after the
Italian reverse and the Russian collapse, when the alliance
would have been severed if we had been responsible for
it. Now, as I told him, this brief spell of dissipation had
saved us from becoming stale. With Victor Boscarelli,
from the Italian embassy, and Clifford van Oss, from the
American Red Cross, we formed a private international
alliance, each entertaining the others by turn and all
swearing friendships that death itself would be powerless
to sunder. A critic might have been puzzled to say
whether Clifford’s Italian was worse than my French;
but our radiant good-will transcended the halting interpretation
of words, and I felt a warmer liking for my
neighbours than I had ever, in my pitiable insularity,
been able to achieve before with men of another race.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“At last,” I pointed out to Lucien, “we can talk amicably
without discussing whether one country did all the
work and another made all the money. There’s a real
understanding. France, England, America: all are at the
very top of their prestige. If we can pull together, we
can make what we like of the peace.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I still think we ought to have gone on to Berlin,” he
persisted. “However, if you back us up and if we can
get what we want without it, I shan’t complain.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Remember you’re all coming to stay with us at
Cannes,” I said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And, on that word, we set out for a house where the
rumour of war and world-settlement seemed never to
have penetrated.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Looking back on the three months which we spent with
my mother, I am in one way reminded of the two years
which Jack Waring passed as a prisoner in Germany.
So complete was our isolation that, when we emerged
from it, we found a world of peace hardly less different
from the one we had left than Jack’s war-world of tanks
and gothas and tear-shells was different from the one
which was blotted out in the early days of 1915. In the
first weeks we saw no visitors; we read no papers; and,
when we were rested enough to think and talk, we turned
to the days when the world had last been at peace and
speculated why the war had come and how other wars
were to be prevented.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The last of my reasons for hurrying abroad was that I
could take up no work in England until I had discharged
the task which Violet Loring imposed on me within a few
hours of her husband’s death. As the world in which we
had been brought up was swallowed by the war, she asked
me to set down my memories of it for the later instruction
of her boy. I had carried my account to 1915; but, after
that, the mass of material was too great for me to attack
in odd hours after my work at the Admiralty. A
steamer-trunk, filled with memoirs and monographs, kept
me company to Cannes; and, in the few weeks that remained
before my cousin came to demand her bond, I
philosophized about the deluge and described the world
before it and speculated about the world that would
appear when the waters had subsided.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Small wonder if at this time, with my mother placidly
dipping into Victorian biographies and with Barbara
dreaming over her share in the history I was writing, we
knew little and cared less about what was happening in
Paris and London, Washington and Rome! While Lucien
de Grammont drew the lines of a recreated Europe, I was
living again through the years when Sandy Loring’s
father and I were fellow-fags and fellow-monitors at
Melton, when we were freshmen at Oxford, when we
ventured together into Edwardian London. The dead so
came to life, as I wrote about them, that sometimes I
would lay down my pen and forget the war for the days
before David O’Rane was blinded and Tom Dainton
killed, the days when every one was quoting Barbara’s
latest epigram and discussing Val Arden’s last novel, the
days when Sonia Dainton broke a heart a week and an
engagement a season. Musing of days and nights softened
by time, I felt that never had there been such years
in the life of any country, never had there been women
and men like those of our generation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In two or three years I expect everything will be very
much as it was before the war,” predicted Barbara.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The people will be different,” I answered; “and
they’ll make everything else different. Sandy’s world
will never be like Jim’s.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And then I fell to wondering what Sandy’s father
would have made of the new dispensation which was taking
shape before our eyes. He and I, who agreed on little
else, agreed that we were saying good-bye, that last night
at Loring Castle, to a phase in history. The old ruling
families had lost their power since the first marquess commanded
his fifteen seats in the unreformed House of
Commons and “Trimmer” Crawleigh dodged in and out
of George the Fourth’s ministries, leaving a broken government
in his train; under a new distribution of wealth
they might lose their prestige. The <span class='it'>arrivistes</span> of the nineties,
who had floated on waves of beer and diamonds into
the arid heights of a depressed territorial aristocracy,
would find their places taken, in the nineteen-twenties, by
social adventurers of ambition equal to Lady Dainton’s
and of wealth greater than Sir Adolph Erckmann’s. A
new class of politician, officer, publicist and financier must
inevitably be brought to birth by the new demands of public
life: the sons of the new men would quickly preponderate
in the old schools and universities, their daughters
would soon come to dominate a new society. That
which I had denounced, in my hotter radical days, as
“privilege” would count for less in Sandy Loring’s life.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was not within my terms of reference to say if the
one order was in any way better or worse than the other:
it was different. My haphazard recollections, covering a
period of about fifteen years, were chosen solely for the
light which they threw on the generation that was of
military age when war broke out.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>As</span>,” I wrote in conclusion, “<span class='it'>the French Revolution
challenged and overthrew the territorial aristocracies and
feudal kingships of the middle ages, so the Great War
challenged the systems which the French Revolution had
evolved in their place.</span>”</p>

<p class='pindent'>There—for the moment—I stopped, for no one could
say what systems the Great War would evolve in place
of those which it overturned. Later, in brooding over
these reminiscences of a vanished generation, I began to
read a moral into them; and, on the morning of Violet’s
arrival, when Barbara bent over my chair to ask if I had
finished my work, I had to answer that, so far as I could
see, it was only beginning.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If I’m right,” I explained, “the old governing classes
are being superseded, under our eyes .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The new lot will pick up the old ideas,” she interrupted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s just what I’m afraid of,” I said.</p>

<h3>3</h3>

<p class='pindent'>My discovery—the one incontrovertible moral that I
could read into the war—had been made by others before
me; and I doubt not that some at least of them
reached it by the same road after toiling conscientiously
through the official explanations and apologies which
every foreign office in Europe issued in proof of its own
innocence. The polychromatic outpouring of white
papers, green books and red books was succeeded by a
vaster flood of unofficial polemics, in which defensive
chancellors and prime ministers, field-marshals and admirals
demonstrated that some one else was responsible
for the war and that peace would have been preserved
or victory secured if only their advice had been followed.
To the strategical arguments I paid little attention: nothing
will make me understand strategy by land or sea,
and it was hardly relevant to my main enquiry. The
diplomatic defence, on the other hand, I studied with
care, deciding—as, I imagine, most people outside Germany
have decided independently—that, while Berlin
was guilty of starting the conflagration, every other power
lent a hand in piling up an inflammable heap of suspicions,
jealousies and misunderstandings. It was this
conclusion that pointed me my moral.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And what do you make of it all?,” my mother asked
as I laid aside the last of these bitter, aggressive manifestoes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well,” I said, “whoever made the war, it’s clear that
no single country, no single form of government was able
to keep the peace.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>With that conclusion no one could disagree.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In contrasting Jim’s world with the present,” I told
Violet Loring, when my essay was ready for her criticism,
“the outstanding lesson is that the government of
man by his fellow-man has broken down in every form
that’s been tried. You had constitutional monarchy in
England, absolutism in Russia, a republic in France and
America, a feudal kingship in Austria-Hungary. None
of them could perform the elementary duty of protecting
the life and liberty of their citizens. Those who took no
part lived on the sufferance of the belligerents. From
China to Honduras .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“When once war breaks out .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.” Violet began helplessly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The governments that allowed war to break out failed
in their first duty,” I maintained. “By negligence or
malignity or impotence they’re responsible for the death
or mutilation of some ten million human beings. It’s not
enough to put the blame on Germany or the kaiser or
Bernhardi. If a homicidal maniac runs amok in England,
we blame the police for not stopping him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>While my cousin turned the pages of my manuscript,
I flung a similar cold douche of first principles over the
head of Philip Hornbeck, who had come to us for a week
between dismantling his old department and erecting the
new.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If you’d had a bigger police-force,” he suggested,
“your homicidal maniac would have had no run for his
money. If we’d smashed the German navy while it was
building .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And turned homicidal maniac on our own account?,”
I interrupted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If you like to put it that way. It’s not much use
arguing with me, George, because I’m one of the old impenitents
who believe that there will always be wars and
what not. <span class='it'>Admitting</span> that it’s the duty of all governments
to keep the peace, <span class='it'>admitting</span> that every government
has failed in its duty, what are you going to do then?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Try a different kind of government,” I answered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A soviet?,” he asked. “If the aristocracy and <span class='it'>bourgeoisie</span>
have failed, that’s all you have left.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’d sooner have a soviet that thought it could keep
peace than an aristocracy that admits it can’t.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You should go and live in Russia,” Hornbeck recommended.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The battle-piece which I was composing for Violet
seemed naturally to take the form of a triptych; and the
first two panels shewed that the governing classes in all
countries had failed to keep the peace and had bungled
the business of making war. When the third panel came
to be painted, I wondered whether they would be more
successful in making peace.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is this going to be a <span class='it'>lasting</span> settlement?,” I asked
Lucien de Grammont, when he came to refresh himself
after his work on the agenda.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’re doing our best,” he answered. “As I told you
at the time, the war stopped too soon. If we’re to secure
that France is never again to be menaced, we must to
some extent carry the war on into the peace.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you still think there will be another war in fifty
years’ time?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I won’t pin myself to a date, but you’ll never abolish
war.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then,” I said, “it’s time you made way for somebody
who will. The old systems, the old diplomacy, the old
men who ran the old system, are a self-confessed failure.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Lucien twirled his neat moustache and addressed to his
neatly-shod feet a muttered confidence about doctrinaire
idealists. Gerald Deganway, for the honour of the old
diplomacy as practised in the British Foreign Office,
screwed his eye-glass into place and exclaimed:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I say, you know, George, you’re an absolute bolshevist!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And Hornbeck administered the most damaging criticism
by accepting my premises and proceeding to a
diametrically opposite conclusion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re proving too much, old son,” he argued. “I
agree that governments should prevent wars, I agree that
every government in the world failed to prevent this last
one. That only shews you’re asking governments to do
an impossibility. Take every nation in turn, from Belgium
to the States, and tell me how the government of
any one could have kept out of the war. When once the
racket begins .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We must go back a stage, then,” I said, “to the time
before it begins. We must have a ‘will to peace’.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Didn’t we have that in England?,” asked Violet.
“Honour apart, we couldn’t afford to stay out in 1914.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You must go beyond England,” I told her. “We
want an international ‘will to peace’; a solemn league
and covenant, not between foreign secretaries, but between
the units of the world’s cannon-fodder. War will
end of its own accord when you can’t fill your armies.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And how will you set your solemn league and covenant
to work?,” Hornbeck enquired sceptically.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I could make no reply until I had found more time to
think; time, too, perhaps, to talk with my uncle Bertrand
of the old Disarmament League and of the propaganda
that issued from <span class='it'>Peace</span> office before the war. When I
told Barbara that, so far as I could see, my work was
only beginning, I felt that in all likelihood the task before
our generation would be to create a ‘will to peace’ out of
the present disgust with war. If history was human
nature repeating itself, there had been the same disgust
at the end of every great war; but the memory of that
disgust faded quickly. It was no match for the urgent
plea that honour or security was at stake; no match for
the cynical resignation of those who said that there always
had been wars and always would be.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course you’re right to try,” was the utmost encouragement
that I could win even from Violet, “but
these Hague Conventions and things haven’t done much
good, have they?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No one has yet appealed to the rank-and-file,” I answered.
“No one has appealed while the full horror of
war was vividly remembered. No one has shewn the
dumb millions of the world how much alike they all
are, how they swim together and sink together. In all
I’ve been reading these last few weeks I’ve been amazed
by the sameness of conditions in all countries. If we can
work on that till the sameness becomes a oneness .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>In aiming at perspective for my second panel, I tried
to set my own impressions and experiences of the war
beside those of the cosmopolitan population that floated
through Cannes in these first weeks of the armistice.
When we had passed the stage of fancying that our individual
histories were unique, I was more struck by the
similarities of what I heard than by the differences.
Necessarily, the islander and the continental must always
disagree on foreign politics; and in Cannes I met for
the first time the chronic terror that is begotten of land
frontiers. “It’s all very well for you,” I was told by
Italians, Greeks, Poles and Dutch: “You’re an island.”
With allowance for this, I felt that the war had left on
every country an almost identical mark. The Austrians
and Germans whom I met in Monte Carlo, old journalistic
allies—for the most part—, were as bitterly convinced
that the war had been forced upon them as we in England
were convinced that they had forced it on us; but, when
we had agreed to differ, their description of the last four
years in their own countries might have been applied,
almost without a word changed, to England. There were,
I discovered, idlers, <span class='it'>embusqués</span> and adventurers of both
sexes in all classes everywhere; and it was amusing, for
one who thought of a German alternately as a sheep and
a genius, to hear the tribute of Austria and Germany to
our more than Teutonic docility and enterprise. France
had her rapacious profiteers, Prussia her bloated munition-makers.
The drinking that was said to obtain in
English high-places could be matched by the drugging
that was reported to be corrupting Austrian society. I
was assured, without calling for proof, that there was
little to choose for courage and endurance between the
best troops of any two countries; and, when the public
morale broke, any one class in its own way cut as sorry
a figure as any other. If I despaired of the populace
that believed the grotesque stories in the Pemberton-Billing
case, I despaired more profoundly of Lady Dainton
when she told me that Prince Louis of Battenberg had
been executed in the Tower for treason.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The moral is,” I told Violet Loring, “that, under an
abnormal strain, the sublime and the dastardly go hand-in-hand.
Five years ago, we didn’t know the meaning
of danger or suffering. To face it without breaking, we
called up the primitive beast that lies inside all of us: he
was a very brave beast, but he was also very treacherous,
savage, credulous.” .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As Violet turned my pages, I looked through a palisade
of palm-trees to the sparkling blue of the Mediterranean
and filled my lungs with warm, scented air. Cannes,
after London, was like the open street after an opium-den;
and, in thinking of the strange shapes seen in the
long, mad half-light of the war, I almost fancied that I
had been dreaming. The political intrigue and chicanery
that began with the high-explosive controversy in 1915
and continued until the 1918 election was incredible unless
one likened it to a panic on board a burning ship. If
Violet had told me four years earlier that one common
acquaintance would be imprisoned for trafficking in cocaine
and that another would commit suicide to avoid
prosecution for forgery, I should not have believed her.
I could now hardly believe my own certain knowledge
until I remembered that every war has claimed its civil
casualties.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How long does it take to chain up your primitive
beast?,” Violet asked. “I mean, .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. these are the
people that the war has left us to live with and work
with.” .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class='pindent'>To that I had no answer ready. It was easier to say
that Sonia O’Rane would not have run away from her
husband before the war than to be certain she would not
run away again. And it seemed idle to talk of international
conferences and a reconstructed world, of a new
spirit and a ‘will to peace’ while the passions of the war
were still unfettered.</p>

<h3>4</h3>

<p class='pindent'>My triptych, displaying—in its centre—the war and—on
either side—the peace that preceded and should
follow the war, spared no space for dividing or linking
frame-work: though I was working in the transition-period
between full war and full peace, I made little attempt
to describe the condition in which we all found
ourselves at the moment when a truce was called.</p>

<p class='pindent'>To some extent—in these blissful, lazy days, when we
had nothing to do but sleep and eat and smoke and gossip—we
filled the blank by discussing the present and future
states of our friends. My battle-piece was subjected to a
more general scrutiny than I had intended; and for many
rather embarrassing days I was challenged to defend myself
against critics who opened wide fields of speculation
with the words:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>If</span>, as you think, the old political game is really played
out .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”; or</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>If</span> you’re right about the redistribution of wealth .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the morning, as we idled in long chairs on a glowing
marble verandah; at night, as we sat in a half-circle while
Barbara played to us; in leisurely afternoon walks and
occasional peripatetic sessions from one bedroom to another,
we discussed war-literature and war-religion, the
new position of women, the fate of the demobilized soldier
and the day-to-day life which we expected to lead
when peace was proclaimed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Most of our predictions were unbelievably wild, in
their assumption either that everything or that nothing
would be the same as before the war; and our discussions
were so formless that they could never be summarized or
recorded. When we abandoned conjecture for the concrete
plans that each was making for himself, I felt that—in
the words used at a dinner to Eric Lane in New
York—‘the convulsion’s as great, when you turn a soldier
into a civilian, as when you turn a civilian into a
soldier.’ Sam Dainton, after ten years’ service, was leaving
the army, “to prey on society”, as he put it. Deganway
was saying good-bye to the Foreign Office; Barbara’s
cousin, John Carstairs, to the Diplomatic. Professionally,
the climax in both their lives had been reached
and passed; the first wanted to make money, the second
to look after his estates.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At this time I began to detect the rise of that adventurer-class
at which history points a punctual finger after
every great war but which I somehow did not expect to
see in my own time. When I was called back to London,
I found new men in Fleet Street and the City, new names
at Covent Garden and in the candidates’ books of the
clubs; at Cannes I discerned, in the good-looking person
of Violet’s brother Laurence, an adventurer in the making.
As I became acquainted with his friends in the
course of the next three years, I saw the natural, perhaps
the necessary, evolution of a type which has not
yet found its place in the social void. My cousin had
been snatched from Melton on his eighteenth birthday
and thrust into the Irish Guards, where his precocious
development as a man-of-the-world had been won at the
expense of his small aptitude for learning. The Hunter-Oakleighs
could not afford to maintain him in idleness;
and Laurence, recognizing this, quartered himself on Loring
House and allowed Violet or any other of his relations
to maintain him. In theory, he was reading for
the bar; and a text-book on Roman law was always
at hand to rebut the charge of idleness. In practice, he
blandly awaited pecuniary compensation from a society
which had taught him expensive tastes at a time when
he might have been teaching himself the means of gratifying
them. The army had paralysed his initiative; he believed—or
affected to believe—that, at one-and-twenty,
his life-work was done; and already he had learned that
personal charm and rich friends were a fair substitute
for industry.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wish you’d advise me about Laurie,” said Violet
one day, with a troubled glance down the verandah to
the bed of down cushions where her brother was devoting
to <span class='it'>La Vie Parisienne</span> the hours demanded by the institutes
of Justinian. “He’s rather a problem.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The whole of his generation is a problem,” I said.
“He stands between Jim, who’s dead, and Sandy, who’s
still a child. He and his like have already borne the
burden of the war; now he’ll have to bear the burden of
clearing up after the war.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>My proposal found less than no favour in the hearing
to which it was directed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m not bearing any more burdens till I’ve made myself
secure,” Laurence declared. “Nor’s any one else.
Half the men I know have come back to see another fellow
doing their job; the other half are like me and never
had a job to come back to. And, while we were away,
you let a pack of women into all the professions,” he
grumbled.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Laurie will marry a rich wife,” Sam Dainton prophesied.
“I’d do the same myself, only I’m so precious
ugly.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That doesn’t matter when men are scarce,” said
Laurence reassuringly; “but I’d much prefer it if <span class='it'>you</span>
married the rich wife and let me blow in as the <span class='it'>tertium
quid</span>. That’s the way all the best marriages are arranged
nowadays.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wonder what the modern girl will turn into,”
drawled Philip Hornbeck at a tangent.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The modern girl is a contradiction in terms,” answered
Lucien de Grammont. “To modernize yourself
is to change; and woman never changes, she only adapts
herself.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She adapted herself in the war, good and plenty,” said
Sam Dainton with authority.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She was brought up to know nothing,” rejoined Barbara;
“she thought she knew everything. With luck
she’ll learn enough to bring her daughters up better than
she was brought up herself.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This from you!,” Violet laughed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s only now that I see what narrow squeaks I had,”
said Barbara reflectively. “Whenever a girl makes a
mess of her life, I believe it’s the parents who are to
blame.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>While this theme was developed in the uneasy hearing
of my mother, Violet took a last look at my manuscript
before handing it back to me.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You say nothing about religion,” she commented in
an undertone. “It’s the biggest thing in life for many
people.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“For women more than for men,” I submitted. While
we were still at school, Darwin, Huxley and Renan were
made accessible to us in cheap reprints. I have felt, ever
since, that, if my salvation depends on faith in something
that ignores ordinary rules of evidence, I would prefer
not to be saved. “And you couldn’t have had a bloodier
war, if we’d all been followers of Anti-Christ.
By a paradox, the only people who tried to live up
to their religion were persecuted as conscientious objectors.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What will you put in its place?,” Violet asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I should only have hurt her feelings if I had suggested
that Christianity might now be given a trial: to her, that
faith is synonymous with the Holy Roman Catholic
Church; to me, it is the service of man, and the Christian
churches with their deadening forms and dead rules, their
deferred punishments and rewards, their proscriptions
and feuds and exclusive salvations have gone far to stifle
Christianity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If people thought less about the next world,” I answered,
“they might make a more tolerable place of
this.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And it was in some such words that I ended my criticism
of the war. The folly and suspicion and malevolence
of all the nations had made it possible; when it came,
all the nations engaged in it exhibited much the same endurance,
if simultaneously they exhibited much the same
savagery.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, is it ‘the Great War’ or ‘the Great Waste’?,”
Violet asked. “Jim was over age when he gave up the
staff. They didn’t want him to go. He felt that every
one who got so much out of England in peace <span class='it'>must</span> go.
<span class='it'>I</span> felt that, too. I shouldn’t like to think I’d helped to
have him killed for no purpose.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>If we had taken a poll of the eager disputants at the
other end of the verandah, I doubt if the verdict would
have satisfied her. On their own admission, the mailed
fist of Philip Hornbeck, the diplomacy of Lucien de
Grammont and the first-hand experience of war which
Laurence and Sam Dainton had won on four fronts provided
no more security than the religion of Violet Loring
that another war, equally or more cruel, unnecessary and
futile, should not break out as soon as the memories of
one generation were grown dim and the exhaustion of
one generation had been repaired.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Doesn’t that depend on the people who’ve survived?,”
I asked. “Until the conscriptionists turned a crusade into
a hunt for cannon-fodder, the war had a moral grandeur.
Whether Jim’s death served a useful purpose for any one
but himself depends on our power to recapture the spirit
of 1914.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>For this elastic formula I can claim little credit. The
cynic is now sure of his laugh if he mocks the idea of
“a war to end war”; but I saw too much of my contemporaries
in 1914 to join the later chorus of fashionable
disparagement. Before their first idealism became
jaded, the young men who had been reared in an atmosphere
of war-preparations and war-scares, who aspired
to a world orderly and a life beautiful and who saw their
aspirations thwarted by men too old for hope or faith,
resolved to create from the war a world of which they
need not be ashamed. They enlisted in the service of
man. From their deaths I learned the phrase. One of
them, the last and best of my friends, who was literally
and awfully crucified, came back blinded and broken to
tell me that he was unrepentant.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>I was in New York</span>,” O’Rane wrote at this time,
“<span class='it'>when the armistice was proclaimed. If you’d shouted
‘as you were’ from the Woolworth Tower, you couldn’t
have scattered people more quickly. ‘As you were before
the war’ is the general feeling. I expect it’s been the
same in England. We must do better than that.</span>” .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m not sure that I know what you mean,” said
Violet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And I’m not sure that I can put it into words,” I
answered. “In general terms, no sacrifice was too great
in the war; I want people to feel no sacrifice is too great
in peace. It’s an empty victory if a high proportion of
the victors are diseased, hungry, verminous, discontented.
Any one of imagination must be ashamed of the slums in
our big cities; but we <span class='it'>won’t</span> make the effort or the sacrifice
to cure them. I want to fan the crusading spirit of
1914 back to life.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Before that, though, we must
make sure that we aren’t going to drift into another war.
That means a crusade covering the whole inhabited
world.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t know how you’ll begin.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nor do I yet. I may be able to tell you more in a
week’s time. Have you heard that the O’Ranes are coming
here? He cabled to say that he was in urgent need
of my advice. I cabled back that I was in much more
urgent need of his.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Glancing at my manuscript for the last time before
sending it to be typed, I felt that, in a week’s time, I
might know better how to paint my third panel. We had
to see now whether those who had failed to avert war
were capable of ending war.</p>

<h3>5</h3>

<p class='pindent'>Though I charged O’Rane at the time with disturbing
the repose of our retreat, I can see now that, even before
I invited him to Cannes, I was resigned to moving at
least one stage nearer to the heart of politics. It is true
that my uncle Bertrand’s appeal for help in his election
was answered with a lame reference to Barbara’s health;
simultaneously I told Frank Jellaby, without a trace of
lameness or indecision, that I was too little in sympathy
with the liberal party to fight a seat on my own account;
all the time, however, I was conscious of a chilling remoteness.
I did not want to go back; I was thankful
that Barbara seemed content to vegetate; but, if I was
right in thinking that the fruits of the war remained to
be gathered, I was right in thinking that they could not
be gathered in Cannes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I hoped that O’Rane, with his knowledge of other
countries, would tell me whether my derided ‘will to
peace’ was practicable or even necessary. If he shared
my misgivings, I wanted his help in planning a campaign
that would be bounded only by the confines of the inhabited
earth and would engage our energies for the rest
of our lives. A train of reasoning is sometimes so persuasive
in its premises and overwhelming in its conclusion
that human intelligence rejects it without argument;
and a train of this kind was presented to me on the eve
of the armistice, when Hornbeck declared in succeeding
breaths that another war would be synonymous with the
end of the world and that nothing could prevent another
war. His first premise was substantiated by all the evidence
of the late war; his second was at least supported
by every soldier and statesman whose memoirs I had
been reading for the last month. The syllogism could
only be refuted by a general strike against war. This
was my revelation and mission; and I had suffered too
long from the revelations and missions of others to trust
my own until I had been put to the question.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The O’Ranes arrived, with my sister and her husband,
a week before Christmas. It was characteristic of the
times that I should first set eyes on my brother-in-law
two years after his marriage. Beryl wrote in 1916 to say
that she was engaged to a certain Gervaise Maxwell,
whom she had nursed at the Lorings’ hospital in Scotland.
They parted after a week’s honeymoon: Beryl went
back to House of Steynes, Gervaise rejoined his battalion
in Mesopotamia; and they met for the second time four
days after the armistice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now they were coming to exploit my influence in finding
work for Gervaise; and I, knowing the slender proportions
of that influence and recollecting the claims
already advanced by Sam Dainton and my cousin Laurence,
wondered helplessly whether the government did
wisely in releasing men from the army before they had
found civil employment. For a week before leaving
London my telephone had been agitated by the voices
of anxious friends who assured me that they could be
demobilized at once if I would invent some urgent private
business for them. “Good pay, light work and
decent holidays,” they all said. I suppose the army let
them go because the army could not retain them. At
Wilminster and Yareham the troops demobilized themselves
and walked home; at Enstaple and Durncliffe they
threatened to mutiny if they were ordered back to
France. It was one thing, however, to kick a uniform
into a cupboard; and something quite different to find
civilian clothes that would fit. Gervaise, I decided, must
wait until I had discussed with O’Rane my own plans.
It might be that, within a few months, I should want all
the men I could get; or it might be that I should be cultivating
my garden in Ireland. I must wait, too, until I
had heard O’Rane’s proposals. Eighteen months had
passed since I hunted him out to America, nominally to
lecture on the war and really to make a fresh start with
Sonia after her disaster with Vincent Grayle. In that
time I had purposely not enquired how they were getting
on, as a fresh start might well be the fresh start
only to more trouble. The woman who jilts two men,
marries a third, runs away with a fourth and returns
with his child, all before the age of thirty-three, has either
too much emotion in her nature or else too little.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I must confess to a feeling of embarrassment as the
train drew in. The feeling passed as Sonia waved ecstatically
from her window and announced breathlessly that
no one would believe what a success she had had in Paris,
that she was insolvent, that this no longer mattered, that
she had the most wonderful news for me, that she was
going to have an unprecedented success in London, that
it was heavenly to see me again and that she was really
going to enjoy herself in Cannes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A woman who lived only for the moment was not
likely to be disturbed by regrets or fears; and, as Sonia
swung down from the train into my arms, her eyes were
as limpid and innocent, her lips were as moistly red and
provocative, as when I took her to supper at her first
parties fifteen years before. Then and now, she was of
those who make the world take them at their own valuation.
Then she had babbled of her earliest ball-room
triumphs; now she described the men who had thrown
themselves at her feet from San Francisco to Paris.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then you enjoyed yourself?,” I asked, when she
paused for breath.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>They</span> enjoyed <span class='it'>me</span>,” she answered complacently. “I
don’t think they’d ever seen anything quite like me before.
Oh, George! Has David told you our news? We
met Mr. Stornaway in London; and he wants us to come
and work with him! Say, kid, can you beat it? I asked
him what the work was; and he said it was just helping
him to spend money. If there’s one thing I <span class='it'>do</span> know
about .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. We’re going to be the new big noise in
London. Collect David; and we’ll tell you all about it!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>If my embarrassment returned as I went forward to
give her husband a hand, it vanished as he took up the
interrupted tale. In voice and manner there was nothing
to hint that he had ever been estranged from his radiant
wife; and I decided that, in a sense, he too lived only
for the moment. When we first met, a small boy without
a friend in the world had decided that he must put
himself to school. His father had been killed, fighting
for Greece against Turkey; and David made his way to
England, with enough money for one term, by working
his passage round the world. When he had sucked in all
that Melton and Oxford could give him, he banished them
into the past, as he had already banished his wanderings,
and concentrated all his energies on making money; when
the money was made, he turned his back for ever on the
oil-fields of Mexico and devoted himself to English politics
until the war imposed on him a more urgent duty.
On the day that he was discharged from hospital, blinded
and maimed, he called to tell me that he had already secured
new work. When Sonia left him, he set himself to
get her back; and, when she returned, I am sure that he
set himself with equal singleness of purpose to forget that
they had ever been parted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now he could think of nothing but Raymond Stornaway’s
proposal.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s where I want your advice,” he explained
gravely, as though in all his thirty-five tempestuous years
of life he had ever taken advice from anybody.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And I want yours,” I told him. “I’m sorry to find
Raymond butting in: I expect to need your help much
more.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>That evening after dinner, when the others had gone
away to gamble, we talked of the war and of that other
evening, when we stood on the dividing ridge between
two worlds. Of the men who dined at Loring Castle on
the last night of peace, he and I alone had survived. We
talked of the war that was over as then we had talked
of the war that was coming. I quoted him the words
in which he had described his vision of what the world
might be after the war; and I challenged him to say
whether he still believed in the perfectibility of man.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve acquired a lot of patience in the last four years,”
he answered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then I tested him with Hornbeck’s prediction that wars
would be fought so long as the human race survived to
fight them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I want you to help me organize a general strike
against war,” I said, as I began to blow out the candles.
Then I paused to frame a question which I had kept unasked
since our last evening of peace: “D’you remember
blowing out the candles that night?” He nodded.
“You left two. Why?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>As he hesitated, I saw that he was frowning. I saw
also that, like the rest of us, he had aged in the last five
years, though the thin face had its old passionate vitality
and the fine black hair its old gay disorder. Slight as
ever, boyish as ever, he was none the less lined with the
mental and physical tortures of the war. His very hesitation
was a subtle mark of decline, as though for the
first time in his life he doubted himself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I knew in my bones that only two of us would come
through,” he muttered. “I should be one; I couldn’t
make a guess at the other.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There aren’t more than half-a-dozen left out of all
our generation,” I told him. “The old club-groups at
Oxford.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I can’t look at them.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And I couldn’t see ’em if I <span class='it'>did</span> look. Not that I need
to be reminded of them.” .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. The unseeing eyes
flashed in sudden exaltation. “What death takes away,
George, is very little by comparison with what he leaves!
The men I’ve loved best in the world have been my father
and your uncle and old Burgess and you and Jim. Three
of you, thank God!, are alive: I stayed with Burgess
for his last night before he retired from Melton; but
you’re no more alive than my father and Jim. Nothing
can take away the time I spent with them.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I shan’t
see again in this world, but nothing can take away all
that I’ve seen in the past. I still see the men I recruited,
the men who trained with me, though I helped to bury
more than a few.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Some of them were here to-night,” I said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes! And what death has done is just to put their
bodies out of action .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. That means there are fewer
hands and more work.” .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As I led him to the door, O’Rane’s fingers ran lightly
down my arm.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s about twenty years since you first came to stay
with us,” I reminded him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I suppose it must be. Good, full years.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I was feeling middle-aged till you came. Middle-aged
and depressed.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He laughed and gripped my hand:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’ve no time to grow middle-aged. It’s the next
twenty years that will count. We must pull together. In
a sense we <span class='it'>are</span> the last two.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>As I blew out the remaining candles, the room once
more seemed to fill with our friends of other days. We
were indeed almost the only survivors; and I could not
tell these ghosts that they had given their lives, I could
not tell O’Rane that he had given his sight, to no purpose.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Think over what we’ve been saying,” I suggested.
“Tell me if you can see any reason why just such another
war shouldn’t break out with just as little reason.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If it does, then this war wasn’t worth while.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
And it’s our business to make it worth while,” he answered.</p>

<h3>1</h3>

<p class='pindent'>Average, sensual man is no match for an enthusiast.
When O’Rane wrote that he wanted to ask my advice,
vague instinct warned me that he wanted the costlier, if
no more valuable, privilege of my personal cooperation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And it was my intention that he should cooperate with
me. If I seemed a doctrinaire to Lucien, a fanatic to
Hornbeck and a ‘bolshevist’—whatever that might
mean—to Deganway, I seemed to myself the mildest
revolutionary that had ever schemed to carry out a revolution
by deputy. When, at this time, people talked of
“winning the peace” and asked what we meant to do,
I felt and said that no active man or woman who had
survived the war was justified in sitting idle. I was
ready to write, speak and subscribe money on behalf of
any organization that would rouse the world to the danger
which I saw threatening it. I would work for my “will
to peace” as others worked, in the years that followed
and along lines which I deplored, for the League of Nations.
I lacked the fire and the endurance, however, to
inspire a crusade. This, I felt, was O’Rane’s part.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nevertheless, from our first conversation I divined
that we were thinking on different planes. To “make
the war worth while”, in my view, was to secure, first
and foremost, that there should be no future wars. Perhaps
because he had spent so many months in America,
where by now the world seemed already to have been
made “safe for democracy”, perhaps because he had seen
too much of the late war to fancy that any one wanted
more of it, O’Rane assumed the end at which I was aiming.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If the war is to be made ‘worth while’,” he pronounced
at the end of our first night together, “we have
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. in some way .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. to make England .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘A land fit for heroes’ and what not,” Philip Hornbeck
interrupted flippantly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After that, though we conducted our debates in private,
I felt that O’Rane’s enthusiasm was sapping my
will to the point when I should be drawn from my own
leisurely crusade and pressed into his. If, at the end
of ten days, he returned to London without me, I can
only explain his failure by saying that in the meantime I
had fallen to the assault of a yet more formidable enthusiast.</p>

<h3>2</h3>

<p class='pindent'>“You heard what Sonia said about Stornaway’s proposal?,”
O’Rane began on the second day.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The rest of the party had disappeared to Monte Carlo;
and I was imprisoned in the shade of a palm-tree until I
surrendered or bolted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He made the same proposal to me,” I said. “I
turned it down because I thought there was more important
work nearer to hand.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Our work won’t lack in importance.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then you’ve accepted his offer?,” I asked. “You’re
giving up the House?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m committed in principle,” he answered. “Yes, I
shan’t stand again: this coupon business leaves no scope
for the independent member. Why the prime minister
wants an election at all, when his position is impregnable .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He wants to keep it impregnable,” I said. “Well,
you’re going in with Raymond to succeed where Deryk
Lancing and his father and every millionaire in history
has so far failed? It’s easier to make money honestly
than to spend it wisely, you’ll find. How much is there?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“About twelve hundred thousand a year.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You can do a lot of harm with that,” I said. “How
will you spend it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“For the first year or two it’s ear-marked for universities
and hospitals.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And after that?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We might make the war worth while,” he laughed.
“But you must help. The trouble with England at present
is that we’ve so little sense of responsibility. Isn’t it
about time we educated people up to a civic conscience?
In the war, I admit .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You found a hundred men who would die for their
country to one who would live for it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Because, in peace, we call people ‘good citizens’ if
they obey the laws and pay their taxes. That’s not
enough for a civilized state, George! Good God, when
a man commits murder, we hire another man to hang
him! It’s you and I who ought to be hanged for not
teaching him our own reverence for law. We hire people
to persecute other people for beating their wives or neglecting
their children or concealing their diseases! It’s
<span class='it'>we</span> who ought to be persecuted. Illness, to me, is the
wound inflicted on society by the indifference of the
healthy. Poverty. Degradation.” .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And your civic conscience .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.?,” I reminded him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Another word for imagination! You’d be ashamed
of yourself if your tenants in Ireland died of want; if
the men drank or the women turned prostitutes. Yet I’ve
seen sights in different parts of the world that would
make your blood run cold. Famines and pestilences and
massacres. Things we don’t allow in England: we’ve got
<span class='it'>that</span> far. Now it’s time we went farther. If the war’s
to be worth while, you must satisfy yourself that what
has been saved was worth saving.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But how on earth are you to do it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>In other days I had heard Aylmer Lancing, as he
wheeled himself with slow impatience about his workroom,
muttering of a dread project to corner the raw
material of high explosives throughout the world. Some
Central American republic was causing him trouble; and
he had decided to make future wars impossible. Later,
I had been present when Raymond Stornaway schemed
to force up the standard of living for manual labour by
paying uneconomic wages in one place and raising a
storm of envious discontent in every other. Both men
had been wonderfully convincing; but they had done
nothing. Behind O’Rane’s shining eyes, in a stain of
shadow between two white sheets of sunshine, I seemed
now to see Raymond’s tired face at his luncheon-party
on Armistice Day.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So far,” said O’Rane thoughtfully, “no one’s gone
about it in the right way.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It was not for want of intelligence. Can it be that
the modern world has grown too fast for any one to
control it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>If I had not parted with my little monograph on the
war, I should have liked to explore this idea that civilization
was bursting like an overripe fruit. Everywhere,
in my own lifetime, I had seen fourth-dimensional energy
collecting in a world of three dimensions. At a far distance,
I had watched the Harrimans and Carnegies and
Rockefellers bowing under wealth too great for a single
man’s direction; and, since we began to raise men a hundred
thousand at a time and to spend money at the rate
of millions a day, I was convinced that we were operating
forces which we could not control. For twenty years I
had tried to “think imperially”, but I doubt if Mr.
Chamberlain himself would have recognized the British
Empire as I saw it represented from my window at the
Admiralty on Armistice Day: in fifty years it had
changed to something that might become a federation of
British states but had certainly ceased to be an empire.
America had ceased to be a nation without becoming
even a federation. When I heard of a gas that would
destroy whole cities, when I read of private fortunes that
could buy whole countries, I felt that the earth was
hardly big enough for its Rockefellers and Hearsts and
Fords; the Rockefellers and Hearsts and Fords themselves
seemed hardly big enough for the monsters they
had created.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No one,” said O’Rane, “has spent twelve hundred
thousand a year to spread his own doctrines. We’ll buy
up derelict palaces like Braye and Eldridge; turn ’em
into schools for the new poor who can’t afford Eton and
the new rich who can’t get in. We’ll stuff them with
scholarships to attract the brightest wits; we’ll have our
subjects taught, as we want them taught, by giving prizes
at Oxford and Cambridge. And, when the best men in
every profession, every walk of life, are men who’ve been
through our mill, we can convert the world.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>What the text-books of a civic conscience were to be I
did not enquire at this stage. If O’Rane aspired to make
each man love his neighbour as himself, that was an
aspiration towards which the Christian churches, usually
with relatively greater wealth, often with the power of
the sword and always with a grip on the fears and hopes
of the faithful, had been working for nearly two thousand
years.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The late war,” I propounded, “was not a good advertisement
for Christian teaching.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Because Christianity has never been brought to men’s
doors and into their lives.</p>

<p class='noindent'>I often wonder what would have happened to Christianity
if it had come into the world with our modern means
of communication.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>We were still arguing when the rest of the party returned;
and, until the brief winter twilight faded, we
sat and spent Stornaway’s money for him. To this day
I can see the half-circle of light dresses and the fire-fly
movements of the men’s cigarettes; I can see faces white
with avarice and eyes dark with excitement.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Over a million a year .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.,” Barbara gasped.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I told you we were going to be the big new noise
in London,” said Sonia complacently. “George, of
course, thinks he’s very superior.” .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I only think it’s a tremendous responsibility,” I defended
myself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If the job’s too big, we can turn it down,” said
O’Rane.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The others thought that, too,” I warned him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was a strange discussion, which ultimately became
a monologue of foreboding. As all the world knows,
Aylmer Lancing made his first fortune by chance and
then found that he could not help adding to it; after
buying the site of a burnt city, he had to build a city
on the site; he constructed railroads to feed his city and
manufactured agricultural machinery to pay for the food.
Daily, until his breakdown, he grew richer; and, in the
long years of his dying, he was to find that, while the
hospitals, the universities, the museums and galleries
could live on his bounty for a year, after that he must
invent new outlets.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If your income’s too big, you can always reduce your
capital,” Sam Dainton contributed. “I’ve been doing it
for years.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“With a capital of five-and-twenty million?,” I asked.
“It’s not a simple question of dropping bags of gold into
the sea.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Early in his career, as I told them, Aylmer Lancing
had tried to sell the New-Mexico-Montana Railroad when
it was threatened by the South-Western Trunk. As he
unloaded, the price fell; and, as the price fell, others unloaded
too. A panic set in at one moment, to be ended
the next by a rumour that Lancing was selling a bear.
Up went the price; and Aylmer sold his last share on a
soaring market, to find himself the richer by several million
dollars.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In time I tired of my Cassandra prophecies. Unlike
his predecessors, Raymond Stornaway was face to face
with a world in which every one would for many years
be trying to pay for the war; and I fancy the annual income
of the trust had been handsomely exceeded before
each of us had explained the best method of spending
it. While my sister Beryl, with her hospital training,
launched vague projects for stamping out phthisis and
cancer, Gervaise rebuilt the more unsightly parts of England.
Hornbeck petitioned for an arctic expedition; and
Barbara threw the stock-markets into confusion by paying
off the national debt.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t say it’s impossible,” I told them in conclusion,
“but Lancing wasn’t the only multimillionaire in
history. Other people have faced his problem, but none
of them solved it.”</p>

<h3>3</h3>

<p class='pindent'>In the two years that followed, O’Rane and I were to
hark back many times to this first discussion; but we
suspended it now before I learned what part he was assigning
me in his moral revolution. The invitations
which I had scattered so impulsively in Paris matured
disconcertingly at the same moment; and we were dragged
from our lazy reminiscences and lazier speculations to
disagree fiercely about frontiers of which I had never
heard and which I suspected Lucien de Grammont of
inventing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As my mother’s villa was by now full, our guests overflowed
to the Regina and came to us only for meals and
for a preliminary peace conference at sundown. Daily,
with noses sensitized to the lure of gin and vermouth, the
dark and voluble spokesmen of the new states collected
to redraw the map of Europe. Through indolence or defective
imagination, the rest of us took little part in the
earlier discussions: the peace, like the armistice, would
be based on President Wilson’s fourteen points; and I
for one was thankful that it was some one else’s business
to unravel these unpronounceable Balkan combinations
and to delimit these undiscoverable Baltic states.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The English are incurably insular!,” Lucien fumed
at short intervals. “If you would look at politics from
a <span class='it'>European</span> point of view, George .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It was our love for the European point of view,”
Hornbeck retorted, “that made us shoulder a heavier
burden than any other power. Our contribution in
money, men, ships .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Though the claim was inoffensive enough to my “insular”
hearing, he was not allowed to finish. The war,
we were assured in spluttering rotation, had been won
wholly and solely by the Belgians in their first defence
of Liège and Namur; wholly and solely by Russian numbers;
wholly and solely by French endurance and strategy.
Italy and Rumania had won it by intervening to prevent
a stalemate; the United States by pouring in money and
men at a time when the allies were exhausted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For an hour the verandah was like a Tower of Babel
attacked by a swarm of bees.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If those who did most to win the war are going to
have most voice in making the peace,” Hornbeck prophesied
as we went up to dress, “you’ll be able to hear their
deliberations in London. This dago-parliament is your
remedy against future wars?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>If I left his gibe unanswered, it was because the tone—still
more the unanimity—of these impassioned voices
had disquieted me. I can hardly say too often that my
mother’s villa was a political vacuum: we all assumed
that, when we emerged from it, we should find the
armistice taking permanent form in a peace drawn on
similar lines. I had not dreamed until this night that a
new war was to be declared at the conference-table. Yet
the demands of my excited young friends were of a kind
that no signatory of the armistice could accept. Paul
Sanguszko, I think, outdistanced all competitors by demanding
a united Poland which in fact included more
Germans than Poles; but Lucien, in his rape of Alsace,
and Boscarelli, in his butchery of the Tyrol, were but a
short head behind him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Aren’t you rather forgetting your old panegyrics
on nationality?,” I asked Lucien.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Are you handing back the German colonies?,” he
demanded in his turn.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s for our dominions to say. I don’t know.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>And</span> you don’t care!,” Lucien rejoined bitterly.
“Now that the German navy is out of the way, nothing
else matters!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“With luck, George, this ought to be a peace to end
peace,” Hornbeck whispered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Next day, I asked Barbara whether she was feeling
homesick for England. I have been so long indentured
to politics that the hint of a new development sets me
fidgeting to be back amid the whispers of the clubs and
the rumours of Fleet Street. Unless I could wholly discount
the wild words of Lucien and his friends, the
peace negotiations would develop very differently from
my expectations; and, whether I could discount him
or not, I was realizing for the first time how far we
had travelled since the day when we talked of fundamental
understanding and a common effort for a common
cause.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you mean you’re tired of this place?,” asked Barbara
with a smile.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I was only feeling we were rather out of things,” I
answered. Then, as the “dago-parliament” collected
round the cocktail-table for a morning session, I caught
Hornbeck’s eye. “Are people in England talking the
same kind of criminal nonsense?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, the House is not sitting,” he summed up judicially.
“On the other hand, there’s a general election
raging. What you lose on the swings, you make on
the roundabouts.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If you <span class='it'>want</span> to go back .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.,” Barbara was beginning
with a sigh, when my mother came on to the verandah
with a cable in her hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was from my uncle Bertrand: if we had a bed to
spare, might he occupy it? Otherwise, would we engage
a room for him at the Regina? He must see me at once.
A letter was following; but, if we did not know already,
he had lost his seat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In so far as any one moment can be separated from all
that goes before and linked with all that follows after, I
suppose this moment should be called decisive. Two
minutes before, my wife had shewn me that she wished
to remain abroad; from this moment hung the chain that
drew us back to London. Twenty-four hours earlier I
had been bandying academic crusades with O’Rane;
forty-eight hours later I forsook my own crusade and
extricated myself from his in order to join my uncle’s.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Bertrand <span class='it'>beaten</span>?,” I cried. “That’s been a safe
radical seat for fifty years!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where are the English papers?,” O’Rane asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It must have been an odd election if <span class='it'>he</span> couldn’t get
in,” said Hornbeck.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Thanks to our isolation, I think we were all taken
equally by surprise. As I read out the strength of the
new parties, our tranquil garden became like a stricken
field the day after battle. For a time we tried to count
the dead; then we found it simpler to hunt for the living.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Runciman’s gone!,” I cried. “McKenna’s gone .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”
Then the tragedy changed to farce. “<span class='it'>Asquith’s</span> gone!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Laurence caught the paper from my hand:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Coalition-liberal .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Coalition-liberal .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Coalition-unionist.” .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The old liberal party’s dead!,” I exclaimed. “There’s
a handful of independents.” .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ireland, except in the north, has gone solid for Sinn
Fein,” Hornbeck read out over my shoulder.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Labour will be the biggest single party in the House,”
said Laurence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You were asking if people in England were talking
the same kind of rot,” Hornbeck reminded me.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then we sat silent as he pieced together this amazing
election and rehearsed the battle-cries on which it had
been won. As he read, I saw O’Rane rising slowly and
facing north with one hand outstretched for an instant
towards the bleeding and exhausted world on the far side
of our sheltering mountains: from Denmark to Italy,
from Ireland to Siberia, two continents were still fighting
for life because one man, nearly five years before, had
flung bombs at another.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’ll take years to undo this,” he muttered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hornbeck read remorselessly on.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The Germans themselves couldn’t improve on it,” he
commented at the end.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But <span class='it'>we</span> can! We <span class='it'>must</span>!,” O’Rane cried. “In
Heaven’s name .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. We went into this to secure the
rights of small nations to a free existence; no one seems
to care whether the big nations have a free existence or
not! Could France and England follow out their destinies
in the days when we lived under the shadow of
this war? Can they do it now, when Europe is being
sown with dragon’s teeth?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>None answered him; but, as I waded later through the
rhetoric of the election, I felt something of the helplessness
that came over me four and a half years earlier,
when one telegram after another shewed us that peace
was slipping momentarily farther from our reach. The
old dispensation could not avert war and could not make
war; was this the third panel of my triptych and should
we have to admit that the old dispensation could not make
peace?</p>

<p class='pindent'>We should all of us, I suppose, have been less thrown
off our balance, if we had been given the least warning
how the election was being conducted. Writing four
years afterwards, I seem to be claiming an exceptional
wisdom for our criticism at this time: section by section,
the electorate that backed the 1918 coalition has withdrawn
its support, though my old liberal colleagues made
no sign of protest at the time. Little by little, the government
itself swallowed its own rash words. The wildest
fire-eater says now what Hornbeck and Laurence, O’Rane
and I—a sufficiently heterogeneous group!—were saying
in the last days of December four years ago. Our
views were an accident of geography, for we were living
in a political vacuum; an accident of history, too, for in
our serious moments we based our expectations on the
settlement of Vienna, believing that we in our generation
were neither less magnanimous nor more insane than the
contemporaries of Castlereagh.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If this is to be the atmosphere of the peace conference
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.” Hornbeck muttered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“These,” I reminded O’Rane, “are the people you’re
going to educate up to a civic conscience.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I must be getting back to London,” was all he would
answer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I was reminded irresistibly of a similar party, similarly
dispersing in the first days of August four and a half
years earlier. We had all said then that we must get
back to London; we could none of us have said what we
expected to do there.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’ll wait till Bertrand comes,” I begged.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes. I don’t suppose a day or two more or less will
make much difference,” said O’Rane. “After all these
years, too .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. It’s a curious thing, George; we’re both
of us Irishmen, both of us men of peace; and, most of all,
we’re reformers. All our working life we’ve seen the
reforms nearest our hearts postponed and postponed by
an eruption in Ireland or by a threat of European war.
God forgive me, I had to stand as a tory and a militarist,
because I saw this war coming! Overboard went all my
dreams of making life tolerable for the sons of Ishmael!
And now again!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I might have added that it was this feeling of futility
which kept me from standing again for parliament when
I lost my seat in 1910.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Until these same sons of Ishmael strike against war,”
I answered, “it’s idle to think of improving their
lot.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And yet it’s so little I’m asking!,” he sighed. “I only
want every man to have freedom to work .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and save
money .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and marry .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and have children .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
without interfering with his neighbours .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and without
interference from them. I want him to spend his old
age in the comfort and peace of mind which he has
earned. His children must be born healthy, to work, to
save, to marry, to live and die as he has done. If civilized
society can’t give him that .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. And it can’t so long as
a country contains one single prison or workhouse or
infirmary or brothel .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I suspect there were brothels in the golden age,” I
interposed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>O’Rane leant forward and gripped my wrist till I
winced with the pain.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In the golden age,” he answered between his teeth,
“there were hopeless, uncaring cynics, who said that
prostitution was the oldest profession in the world. Slavery
was the oldest solution of all labour problems. Torture
was the oldest safeguard of civil authority. The
moral sense of the world must be roused till it sweeps
away prostitution and disease, as it swept away torture
and slavery. It was not to keep them flourishing that we
went to war. And we <span class='it'>can’t</span> sweep them away while another
war threatens.” .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He broke off, as my mother came into the garden with
the day’s letters; and, as I struggled against the impact
of my uncle’s fury, I recognized that I was being assailed
by a stronger enthusiast even than O’Rane and
being asked to save by propaganda a world that I thought
had already been saved by war.</p>

<h3>4</h3>

<p class='pindent'>Bertrand’s descent upon Cannes may be likened to the
unheralded arrival of the headmaster in a form-room
that has for some time been left to its own devices.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘<span class='it'>The Theodosian code</span>’,” Laurence recited virtuously,
“ ‘<span class='it'>was published in Constantinople on the 15th of February,
438 .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</span>’ If Bertrand tries to find me a job, say
I’m suited, thank you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The rest of us, for all our feeling that we were drowsing
in a back-water, looked regretfully at the blazing
hibiscus-hedge and guiltily at one another.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We all ought to be going back,” said Barbara, who—six
weeks before—had never wished to see Dover Cliffs
again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I asked what good we could do; I nearly told her what
harm we could not avoid doing, for Eric Lane had crossed
from New York on O’Rane’s boat and was now in London.
Bertrand’s outpouring, however, was beyond the
range of argument.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>You will find</span>,” he predicted, “<span class='it'>that the world is entering
on a new glacial age of materialism. We must
fight it.</span>”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And his method of fighting it was to resurrect our old
paper, to set me in the old editorial chair, to sweep the
country with new propaganda and to create a new political
party in the dining-room of Seymour Street.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Those who have never edited a paper are inclined to
compare themselves with Delane at his most legendary;
and the comparison is seldom favourable to Delane or to
<span class='it'>The Times</span>. Those who have never tried to influence
opinion—as my uncle and I tried in six years’ devoted
service to the Disarmament League—become in their
daydreams a rival to Parnell or Gladstone and convert
mass-meetings with a single speech. Hard-won experience
had taught me better, yet this is what Bertrand proposed;
and Barbara, I knew, was seeing herself already
as the maker of cabinets and the adviser of kings.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Read your Balzac</span>,” my uncle recommended in a disastrous
postscript. “<span class='it'>London, for the next few years of
your life, will be amazingly like Paris in the restoration-period .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</span>”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was the postscript, I think, that fired Barbara’s imagination;
and, as I watched her big eyes lighting up, I
knew that it was empty to ask if she felt competent to
stay a glacial age in its course. For a year or two before
the war, she had occupied a position that, so far as I
know, had never before been accorded in England to an
unmarried woman, certainly to an unmarried woman of
twenty. Raised above ordinary laws by her utter fearlessness,
she had imposed a law of her own, in dress and
manners, speech and thought, upon the greater part of
her generation. As a child, Barbara has often told me,
she saw that her personality would be bled white by her
father’s. In Ottawa, in Simla and in London her wings
beat unceasingly against the political, the religious and
the social bars of the Crawleigh cage. Then she asserted
herself; and, ten years later, she was known by
sight wherever an illustrated paper penetrated; the first
colonial contingents demanded to see Westminster Abbey
and Lady Barbara Neave; and, had she ever paused, she
might have seen herself becoming a legend in her own
lifetime, as Bernhardt—on vastly more bizarre lines—became
the heroine of the ‘Sarah myth’ in France.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I had my answer to the question which I had asked
myself on Armistice Day, when she gazed into the fire
for a picture of what her own new life was to be. London,
in the restoration-period, was marked out for her
empire.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When my uncle arrived, his mood was made apparent
by the sombre opening statement that nations got the
governments they deserved. He added, with fine public
spirit, that the worst result of the election was the lack
of an effective opposition. Then less impersonal feelings
broke through: he charged ministers with treating the
fourteen points as ‘a scrap of paper’ and recommended
a strait-waistcoat for all who escaped the lamp-post.
Sitting in a half-circle round his chair, with Lucien’s
international parliament huddled on our fringe, we were
castigated with a fury that would have been better deserved
if we had in fact uttered the vain things with
which we were charged: <span class='it'>we</span> had promised that there
should be no punitive damages and now <span class='it'>we</span> were threatening
to squeeze Germany like an orange; <span class='it'>we</span> were
pledged to try the kaiser, if not to execute him without
trial; <span class='it'>we</span> were to restore our trade by destroying our best
customer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If I’d asked for the kaiser’s head on a charger,”
Bertrand thundered, “you’d have promised me <span class='it'>two</span> heads
on <span class='it'>two</span> chargers.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>When the first fury had abated, Lucien fanned it to
life by a reference to the peace of Brest-Litovsk, demanding
why Germany should be treated more tenderly in defeat
than she had treated others in victory.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If England had been <span class='it'>invaded</span> .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.” he went on with
a kindling eye. “The mistake your prime minister made
was that he didn’t say enough.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You should have thought of all that before you agreed
to the armistice,” Bertrand retorted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, say, the terms of the armistice .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.” began
Clifford van Oss.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I have no doubt he was going to say that, if the French
quoted one set of undertakings against us, then America,
which had drawn the terms, would speedily quote another.
My uncle, however, who detested what he called
“the American habit of making speeches instead of conversing”,
broke in with a speech of his own:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not that it matters whether he said too little or too
much! The speeches have served their turn. I tell you,
Lloyd-George is a better journalist than Northcliffe in
knowing what the public will want the day after to-morrow!
<span class='it'>He</span> knew that, when the troops came home to
find no job waiting for them, people would forget they’d
ever called him ‘the man who won the war’. Before
they forgot him for high taxation, high prices, falling
wages and a creeping paralysis of unemployment, he had
to make himself snug. <span class='it'>And he has!</span> Five years of autocratic
power with the certainty that something <span class='it'>must</span> turn
up; five years’ support from the Curzons and Milners
who’d never have seen the back-door of office without
him; five years’ support from the Monds and Greenwoods
of the liberal second-eleven; five years’ support
from every man who’s lost a son, every woman who can’t
make both ends meet. You need only promise to hang
the kaiser and make Germany pay: England was worth a
general election.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bertrand’s outburst was followed by a long silence;
and, as he chewed his moustache and gathered strength,
I fancied that he might be reflecting how much he had
aged since we incubated the Disarmament League in
Princes Gardens and hatched <span class='it'>Peace</span> out of a grimy office
in Bouverie Street.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You give this lot five years, sir?,” asked O’Rane.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Unless they blunder into a new war before then,”
Bertrand answered; “or unless we can make an opposition
strong enough to break them.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>As he swung round on me, I pointed out that he was
forming an opposition before he had anything tangible
to oppose.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We must <span class='it'>shape</span> the peace!,” he cried. “I give you
till to-night to make up your mind! If you desert me,
George, I shall fight single-handed. And I’m getting too
old for that. Where’s Barbara? I must explain what’s
expected of her.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I capitulated without even taking my hours of grace.
When Bertrand stumped indoors, I knew he was going to
depict a shattered and mutinous army of liberals rallying
to our exhortations and reconciled by Barbara’s diplomacy.
I knew, further, that, outside the pages of a
woman’s novel, politics never had been so theatrically arranged.
Lord Crawleigh might dine with his daughter,
but he would never vote with his son-in-law. Frank
Jellaby and the independent liberals might, if we caught
them unawares, maintain a civil front to the coalition-liberals,
but they would never serve in the same administration
as the men whom they charged with stabbing them
in the back. None of this, however, was likely to influence
Barbara in her present mood of exaltation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Liberalism,” said my uncle in one of his fine, vague
phrases, “is greater than the liberal party.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In the present state of the liberal party,” I answered,
“that would not be difficult. But you don’t <span class='it'>believe</span> you’re
going to make a new party of any kind.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bertrand shook his head mournfully and sat with the
far-away expression of an old and tired man who had
sampled in his time the liberalism of Mazzini and Lincoln,
Bright and Cobden, Bradlaugh and Chamberlain,
Gladstone and Asquith.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If we can bring liberalism back to life,” he sighed,
“a party will form without our help: all we need is a
rallying-point. I mean something bigger than electoral
reform and tariff squabbles, George: I mean a liberal
spirit in politics. At the beginning, I should have called
this a liberal war. When Wilson aimed at a peace that
should leave nobody too strong, nobody too much
broken, I called that a liberal spirit. I wrote to you about
the glacial age of materialism, because a liberal spirit is
the only thing that can melt it. Every individual, every
country will fight for its own hand: it’s instinctive, like
food-hoarding in 1914. Does Lucien care if Russia’s
starving? Does van Oss care if England’s crippled with
debt? Does any one care if the majority get less than
the best out of life? Devil take the hindmost! That’s the
spirit we have to fight.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But can it be done with a sixpenny review?,” I asked.</p>

<h3>5</h3>

<p class='pindent'>When our other guests had left us, Bertrand, Barbara
and I set ourselves to collect our headquarters staff.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Old men,” boomed my uncle oracularly, “make wars;
and young men fight them. We must be surrounded by
the young men.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He then sat back, in the attitude which had become
characteristic of him since his stroke, with his hairy,
gnarled hands clasped over the ivory knob of his stick.
I saw Barbara’s dark eyes shining as she hurried indoors
and returned to the verandah with a pencil and paper.
In her absence, Bertrand sought to seduce me by describing
my room at the office and hinting at the furniture
which he proposed to transfer from Princes Gardens.
He resented my criticism that we were setting out to convert
the world with six dubious Sheraton chairs and less
than six more than dubious phrases; but, as we drafted
our programme, I became ever more gloomily convinced
that we were losing sight of the essentials in a wanton
outburst of ornamentation. My excellent and unpractical
colleagues agreed that we could have a delicious meal
sent in from the Greyfriars Tavern for the editorial dinners;
Barbara fought gamely for a weekly cartoon;
Bertrand informed us, with an air of originality, that
the youth of the nation were the trustees of posterity;
and no one said a word about our gospel or our
prophets.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All the conditions are new,” my uncle reminded me
at short intervals. “We need new men, new methods.
A new spirit .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And, while he coined phrases and Barbara designed
our front page, I thought over the young men whom I
had met when I was working at the Admiralty. Spence-Atkins
and Jefferson Wright were still on Hornbeck’s
“live register” of unemployed; and I invited them to
take charge of our foreign policy and economics. That
their names were unknown seemed a recommendation to
Bertrand, who exclaimed in high glee:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“New men! To catch the other new men!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>On that, I presented him with a cynical jack-of-all-trades
whom Hornbeck had engaged for his experience in
the deeper waters of undetected roguery. I have no proof
that Triskett’s hands were soiled, though a man whose
friends included the scamps of every race and country
must have lived under constant temptation to blackmail.
I did not propose to give him free scope in what he wrote;
but I thought that his curious information might sometimes
illuminate an obscure motive.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A new man to catch the other new men,” Bertrand
repeated.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A thief to catch a thief,” I answered; “but, if it’s
youth you want, these men are all under thirty-five.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The average was reduced further when, at Barbara’s
suggestion, I invited a novelist of thirty, a poet of twenty-five
and a composer of nineteen to take our artistic pages
under their protection. They were all, she told me,
touched with genius. I was also becoming reckless.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And now,” said Bertrand, “can you set them to work
in three months’ time? You’ll want that to get in touch
with new conditions. You must study life in the marketplace,
George. Mass-feeling. The great movement of
men.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. We’ll have our first editorial dinner somewhere
about the end of March.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I should have it,” I suggested, “on the first of April.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>When my uncle returned a few weeks later, we returned
with him; and, while Barbara made our house ready for
party-meetings and drawing-room conclaves, I carried
the dubious Sheraton chairs to Fetter Lane and passed
from the Eclectic Club to my uncle’s study in Princes
Gardens, in leisurely pursuit of the great movement of
men.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I doubt if I have at any time felt more out of my element.
I could understand O’Rane’s contention that, for
all they won from civilization, the vast majority of mankind
would be no worse off by taking to the hills and
woods as bandits. I was prepared to work quite reasonably
hard for my rooted faith that, if this vast majority
was to be saved, it must be saved by its own efforts. I
could sympathize with the proselytes to the League of Nations,
though I placed no reliance in a league that did not
make disarmament its first condition of membership.
What I wholly failed to grasp was my uncle’s objective
in taking an expensive office, exhuming our old manager
from his retirement and entering the name of our paper
once more at Stationer’s Hall.</p>

<p class='pindent'>London had never, in all my experience, been so little
interested in politics.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What’s been happening?,” Sam Dainton echoed when
I took Barbara to dine with his parents. “Well, I’ve
awarded myself the order of the bowler-hat; and I had
the hell of a time in Paris after I left you; and now I’m
thinking how I can make a bit of money.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Same here,” added John Gaymer. “If you come
across anything, George .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, the family first,” Laurence interrupted. “<span class='it'>Dear</span>
Cousin George .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The conversation at most dinner-parties in these weeks
seemed to run on ways and means. Seizing on the jargon
of the times at a moment when every one else was abandoning it,
Lady Dainton described herself facetiously as
“one of the new poor” and denounced every more fortunate
neighbour as a “profiteer”, though I could not
see that her novel poverty compelled her to retrenchment
nor that her scorn for profiteers prevented Sir Roger’s
trying to sell Crowley Court, at three times what he gave
for it, to one of “the new rich”. In place of retrenchment
I found a bewildering blend of ingenuity, industry
and blackmail on the part of those who insisted on a life
of pleasure and could find no one to finance it for them.
Day after day, Barbara was dragged to new shops, where
her friends sold her hats at exorbitant prices. Other
friends offered to decorate our house. Others, again,
begged me to open a “social” column in <span class='it'>Peace</span> and to
put them in charge of it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You can’t expect people to take much interest in
public affairs,” Lady Dainton said to me at this first
dinner. “There are <span class='it'>so</span> many other things! These children”—she
looked benevolently round the table at the
girls she had collected for the approval of her necessitous
son—“they don’t know what society <span class='it'>was</span> before the war.
They’ve none of them even been presented, so you can
imagine the flutter they’re in. Their first season!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I shouldn’t have thought any one had the money to
make much of a season,” I objected, with a cast back to
her late confession of universal ruin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The war has only transferred it from one pocket to
another,” she assured me.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This dark saying was made plain in these first unsettled
days before the rebirth of our paper, when I drifted about
London, analysing the atmosphere of the armistice. Less
diplomatically, Lady Dainton might have said that, if the
natives had too little money, the foreigners had too much;
and, without a trace of diplomacy, a number of my acquaintances
seemed to be coaxing it back from the new
pockets to the old. With my own ears I heard the
Duchess of Ross demanding a list of the Americans she
could advantageously invite to her house. I listened with
amusement as Clifford van Oss tried to explain politely
that the people on whom she fawned were not received in
New York. And I watched Sir Adolf Erckmann being
made a test case for the date at which a wealthy man with
a German name could be received by his less wealthy
friends.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The great movement of men isn’t carrying me anywhere
in particular,” I confessed to Bertrand as the day
of our first issue drew near. “I’ve met a number of
spongers, lately, and a greater number of snobs. Which
are the more to be pitied .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s only a phase,” my uncle answered. “London’s
only a part of England; these people are only a
part of London. While you were a boy, you must have
seen the Rand Jews agonizing to fill their houses; and you
saw the ‘new poor’ of the Harcourt death duties taking
all they could get.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And we saw the result in the last years before the
war,” I said, as Sir Adolf Erckmann shambled out of
earshot. Could we give rein to our racial prejudices, I
never knew whether I would sooner lynch him or the
girls, like Sonia Dainton, who in those days had endured
his odious familiarities for the sake of a string-quartet,
a champagne supper and a free drive home in an Erckmann
car. “A whole generation grew up in the belief
that man had a natural right to be amused at some one
else’s expense.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’d have found the same thing in Rome and Nineveh,”
said Bertrand. “Whenever a conspicuous social
position is divorced from the means to keep it up .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
<span class='it'>That’s</span> not a thing to notice. I told you to study the
movement of men because one class is being squeezed out
of existence. It may last my time, but it won’t last yours.
It was never a big class, but in some ways it was the best.
Now the sons have been killed; and the parents are crippled
with taxation. Who’s coming to take their place,
George? That’s the riddle for boys like you; and it’s to
the newcomers we must appeal.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Is everything
ready for our first number?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“As ready as it can be,” I answered, “without a principle,
a policy or even a catchword.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>When I went to Fetter Lane for the ceremony of ordering
the machinists to print off, I was glad to see that my
colleagues shewed no lack of enthusiasm. Headed by
Bertrand, we marched to the Clock Tower Press and
stood in a half-circle till he should give the sign. Martin
Luther, printing his own bibles, could hardly have been
more impressive; and, as we marched back to toast Bertrand
in tepid champagne, the day seemed pregnant with
fate.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All the same,” I said, as we dispersed, “you’ve none
of you suggested a single reason why any one should
want to buy this paper. People are simply not thinking
of politics.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They will, when they come out of their fool’s paradise,”
answered Bertrand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>With a prediction so vague I could not contend. Reconstruction,
of which I had heard so much in the last
years of the war, appeared to stop short when private
lives and fortunes had been reconstructed. Employment
was good; money was plentiful; trade was booming; and,
after we had spent five million pounds a day without suffering for it,
after we had found work for every one at
his own price, it was not wonderful if the laws of political
economy seemed to have been suspended. My brother-in-law
Gervaise was but one of many whom I settled on
the permanent wage-sheet of the country; during the next
few days I was to help Sam Dainton into an engineering
firm at Hartlepool and to be told that the directors could
accommodate as many more of the same kind as I chose
to send.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was too good to be true; it was too good to last;
but, while it lasted, I felt we could expect little support
for gloomy vaticinations that were being falsified under
our eyes.</p>

<h3>1</h3>

<p class='pindent'>At the end of March, as Bertrand had ordained, our
first editorial dinner took place. It was followed by a
reception; and the two events might have been read, by
the optimistic, as an announcement that a new force was
at work in political and social London. Throughout the
long preparations, Barbara told us repeatedly that she
had no personal interest in our organization; but she
could not have worked harder if this had been a battle
which she had to win or a lost battle which she had to
retrieve. For the first time since our marriage, she seemed
fully alive; the old love of ascendancy had returned; and
I forgot the futility of my uncle’s crusade in the happiness
which it brought to my wife.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, I wasn’t going to spoil <span class='it'>your</span> life, if I could help
it,” she laughed, when I complimented her on her new
radiance. “Whatever kind of mess I’ve made of my
own .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s early days to be saying you’ve made a mess of
your life,” I told her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>These first weeks had been less formidable than I had
expected. Every one was too busy with his own concerns
to recall the furious tongue-wagging of the war; and the
players in what Barbara counted her tragedies had obligingly
withdrawn from the stage. Jack Waring, the first
of her victims, crossed my path but once in three
years: I met him hurrying out of his tailor’s, and he
stopped only long enough to say that he was breeding
blood-stock in the midlands and hardly ever came to London.
Eric Lane, a greater sufferer in a longer tragedy,
had disappeared; I was told that he was in London and
I assumed that he must be at work on a new play. Certainly
we did not see him for several months; and it was
only in rare, startling moods of depression that Barbara
seemed to remember him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How much you feel depends on how much you put
into life,” she suggested, a little wistfully. “You can
make a mess of your life when you’re a child, if you go
the right way about it. <span class='it'>You</span> wouldn’t, because you let
other people live your life for you; but I always had to
make mine a great spiritual adventure, a thing to be
squeezed dry, not tasted! At the end I must feel that
I’ve taken a wonderful journey and that every moment of
it has been marked by poignant emotions, vivid experiences.
The whole of myself must go into everything.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“When you see a <span class='sc'>wet paint</span> sign, you must make
sure that the paint is really wet?,” I asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“With both hands! Unlike my dear George, who
avoids all paint because some of it is sometimes not quite
dry. We’re a strange and wonderful combination, darling.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The actor and the audience.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re content just to look on?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Life is varied enough!,” I said. “And, though I
don’t suppose any period is dull when you know it, I
believe our own period is the most interesting in all history.
I believe, too, that we’re in the most interesting
part of the most interesting period. Bertrand will tell
you that our day is over and that the future lies with
the new men. I’m watching.”</p>

<h3>2</h3>

<p class='pindent'>My uncle’s opinion was endorsed, perhaps naturally,
by one who was a new man himself and who introduced
me at this time to some at least of the other new men.
Nearly four years have passed since I began to watch this
battle of old and new; I am watching still, and the battle
is undecided. It was on the day when our paper was
reborn that our old advertisement-manager called in
Fetter Lane to prove that we were working on wrong
lines; and, as he knew enough of mob-psychology to make
a fortune out of it, I listened respectfully to the criticism
and studied the critic. Sir Philip Saltash had travelled
far since the August day when Bertrand paid off the staff—Mr.
Saltash included—and brought <span class='it'>Peace</span> to an end
by shivering the electros of the headings with a mallet;
he was to travel farther before he entered the House of
Lords as Lord Saltash of Bonde, publicity-expert and
political wire-puller. How much farther he will travel is
another of the things I am watching.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If <span class='it'>you</span> think people will listen to the <span class='it'>stuff</span> your old
man’s put in his <span class='it'>prospectus</span>,” he began with a force and
directness that made me feel the new men were bringing
new manners with them, “you’re making the mistake of
your life. You may be right; every one else may be
wrong .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>As he paused with a shrug of contemptuous challenge,
I reminded myself that he was come to offer me publicity
for <span class='it'>Peace</span> and must therefore prove that, without publicity,
<span class='it'>Peace</span> would wilt and die.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My uncle feels,” I said, “that it’s bad policy to cure
one Alsace-Lorraine by setting up half-a-dozen others.
It’s time <span class='it'>some</span> one made a protest against the last election.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Even if no one pays any attention to it? Mark you,
I can <span class='it'>make</span> people listen,” he added, as he rolled an unlighted
cigar from side to side of his loose mouth; and
I tried to recall how many million pounds Saltash had
advertised into war-loans and how many thousand men
he had ordered, from his ubiquitous hoardings, into the
army. “That’s my job. <span class='it'>Has</span> been, ever since I left
you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How would you make people listen to <span class='it'>us</span>?,” I asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Saltash caught up a copy of our first number and
turned the pages with loud slaps of an annihilating hand.
I have forgotten his technical proposals, though I remember
that he kindled me with his cleverness the while he
was outraging me with his vulgarity. I have not, however,
forgotten his lyrical flights in describing the place
of publicity in public life. I had met “press-secretaries”
and heard of “propaganda sections” in government departments;
I had suspected that certain ministers were
raised or disgraced at the bidding of certain newspaper-proprietors;
but I had not imagined that newspaper-proprietors
themselves struck or spared at the behest of men
like Saltash, who in their turn controlled the flow of
information from Whitehall to Fleet Street.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s a question of spot-light,” Saltash explained; and
I learned that, when Dormer came to grief over food-rationing,
it was Saltash’s artful manipulation of the
switches that saved him from public vengeance and secured
him his seat in the cabinet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I never <span class='it'>did</span> think Dormer was to blame,” I happened
to interpose.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I never let you!,” cried Saltash. “Remember the
Flying Corps scandal? <span class='it'>I</span> did that. And you soon forgot
about Dormer. I told him from the first he had only to
lie quiet.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Later on .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Later on, without prompting, I remembered Dormer’s
reappearance. Discovered by the caricaturists and taken
to the heart of the public, Dormer—with his vast chin
and grotesque hat—became a music-hall hero. “Our
Willie” was acclaimed by the gallery with the loyal
fervour accorded in other days to “good old Joe”. The
<span class='it'>Snap-Shot</span> shewed him pruning roses with his smiling
wife in an “old-world garden” and playing bumble-puppy
with his apple-cheeked children. Finally, in the
last days of a united front against a common foe, his portrait
was thrown on the screen—after those of King
Albert and General Joffre, Lord Kitchener and Mr. Lloyd-George—as
the man who had saved England from
starvation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The cost of Dormer’s apotheosis was one baronetcy
and the promise of a peerage when the more squeamish
section of the government was better used to the Saltash
idea.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Spot-light,” repeated the wizard. “People can’t look
at more than one thing at a time. Has it ever occurred
to you why the old coalition went and the new one came?
The ginger-group were working that way from the day
Asquith carried conscription for them; they didn’t need
him after that, but the public wasn’t ready for a change.
Well, it was my job to <span class='it'>make</span> the public ready. I concentrated
opinion against certain men and never left ’em
alone; I concentrated in favour of others. The Dardanelles.
Mesopotamia. Shells. Food. You and I know
that the new lot were tarred with the same brush as the
old; but we made the public think they’d been on another
planet when all these messes were made. The old lot
were too quiet; they never hit back.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There was a war on,” I reminded him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They would never have fallen if they’d shewn fight,”
Saltash retorted. “A man’s power in politics is what he
makes others believe it to be. ‘This war is too big for
ordinary folk,’ people were saying: ‘we want supermen.’
Well, we said the new lot <span class='it'>were</span> supermen. When
there weren’t enough to go round, we made so much din
that office-sweepers seemed like supermen. We restored
confidence; and we frightened the Germans. Now, you
say you’re reviving the old rag and your slogan is to be
‘a <span class='it'>lasting</span> peace’. You’ll be called pro-Boche. You’ll be
told you’re letting the Hun off. I don’t despair, though.
The first thing is to out the present lot; and I can do that
on departmental scandals alone. ’Got all the papers.
Then we must prepare a big peace-boost.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Lunch
with me and talk it over.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Though I had nothing to discuss, I went with Saltash
because Saltash hypnotized me to come. All the vitality
of young America radiated from him, though he styled
himself a Canadian; his features recalled semitic South
Russia, though he dissembled his love for the Jews; in
the ten or twelve years that I had known him I never
detected a trace of breeding, education or principle; and
in the next two years I was never to see him entirely
sober. Until he has his first stroke, however, I count him
one of the six most dangerous men in Europe, for the
“yellow” press of every country is an instrument on
which he has played himself into wealth and power. As
a purveyor of publicity, he is the logical conclusion from
the cheap press that came into existence when England
was taught, willy-nilly, to read; and England is imperilled
by him, as she is imperilled by every man who, in his
daily work and life, has everything to gain and nothing to
risk.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>I</span> trouble waters,” he explained thickly. “<span class='it'>Other</span> fellers
do fishing. No personal axe t’ grind.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>After a champagne luncheon he talked to me of these
others. If the war unified the British Empire, it also
brought to England a number of adventurous spirits who
had made existence unsafe for themselves in their native
dominions and whose claim to a hearing depended less on
their political wisdom than on the number of miles they
had travelled to reach Downing Street. The blatant
harangues of Mr. Giles to indulgent imperial conferences
were received with so much respect that hysterical women
petitioned to have him included in the war-cabinet; a
country with population and wealth equal to the city of
Glasgow ranked in our councils as a great power.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>I</span> did that,” Saltash confided. “Overseas dominions.
Young wolves claiming place council-rock. People here
<span class='it'>crawled</span> to him. And the government didn’t dare snub
him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So long,” I said, “as the prophet comes from another
country, he has full honour in ours.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He was a cut above some of them,” said Saltash defensively;
and I was told of one great public man who
had dodged the dock in Australia to buy papers in England,
of another who operated in London because he was
threatened with a bullet in his brain if he ventured back
to Winnipeg. Though Saltash did not say so, I think
they may have fished in the waters which he troubled.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The revenges of time!,” I said, as I stood up to go.
“This is the remittance-man come home to roost.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A party can’t exist without funds,” said Saltash,
beckoning to our waiter for a third liqueur. “Or without
publicity.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>That I was not prepared to contest; and, as a new-born
party had to collect its funds and build up its organization
at short notice, I was not surprised that the rich men
surrounding the coalition were more numerous and less
savoury than the sufficiently dubious candidates for honours
whom I had seen haunting the whips’ office during
my active political career. If I was to believe Saltash,
however, London had suddenly become a hunting-ground
for the desperadoes of the empire. These “new men”
were unknown names when the war began; soon I heard
of them whenever a political crisis was being engineered.
Their ability was undoubted; their experience had been
gained in rough schools; and their resourcefulness admitted
no limit. Supplying the impecunious with money
and the affluent with advice, they acquired knowledge
and influence which they used to acquire more money;
and this in turn purchased them a further power of unseen
interference in the direction of our government.</p>

<p class='pindent'>That night, as I sat down to our inaugural dinner, I
told Bertrand of my host at luncheon and of his conversation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s no new thing,” said my uncle, who in these nights
of doubt and sorrow unmasked an almost irritating resolution
to be jolly at all costs. “The great international
financiers have influenced governments and been influenced
by them since banks and governments began.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Historically, that may have been true. The new thing,
as Bertrand himself might have said, was the character of
the new men and the new methods which they employed.</p>

<h3>3</h3>

<p class='pindent'>This dinner was to be my last frolic as an irresponsible
spectator.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When, as editor and managing-director, I proposed the
toast of “<span class='it'>Peace</span>”, a vibration from my colleagues’ eagerness
troubled my rigid negations and stirred doubt in my
bland assurance. <span class='it'>Was</span> Bertrand’s project so hare-brained
as I had thought? I questioned myself in honest uncertainty
as I settled my tie and looked down on the double
row of expectant faces. The old man’s predictions at
Cannes were fulfilled as soon as the conference met and
a vague parliament of man reformed as a quarrelsome
committee of ten; the clash between President Wilson’s
fourteen points and Mr. Lloyd-George’s election speeches
rang out when the committee of ten shrank to a camarilla
of four; and, if we had ever doubted the apathy of the
British public, our doubt must have evaporated day by
day as the first House of Commons in the new glacial age
sat with hands folded and eyes set jealously on the position
each member had wrested from the war. Twice or
thrice in these months a vigilance-committee of sterner
and more unbending new members sent hectoring telegrams
to keep their representatives up to the mark; President
Wilson once ordered his ship to get up steam; and
the Duchess of Ross dined out intermittently on M.
Clemenceau’s latest epigram; but it is substantially true
to say that no one in England thought of the peace-treaty
until it was submitted for the approval of parliament.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In my speech I confined myself to congratulating Bertrand
on his staff. At the end, he hoisted himself slowly
to his feet and indicated his own part in our endeavour:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You young men will have to do the work; but perhaps,
from a long experience, I may be able to advise you.
No lasting peace can be founded on a sense of grievance;
and, though the heathen are raging furiously now, they’ll
outgrow that phase. Maybe it’s because I had to keep
my mouth shut during the war, maybe old age is making
me more radical. This is not a party organ, it never was;
it was an expression of liberal spirit, and that’s what it
has to be again. We were called hard names when war
broke out; but we had the right vision. Labour still
thinks parochially; toryism still thinks imperially, which
is the same thing; radicalism must think internationally.
These fierce local patriotisms are an unconscionable time
a-dying; but England is a bigger conception than the
heptarchy, Europe is a bigger conception than England,
the world is a bigger conception than Europe. We depend
too much on our neighbours to blow them out of
existence every few years. That truth has been vouchsafed
to those of us who are at this table; we have to get
it accepted.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I rang a bell; and we were handed early copies of our
first number. Every man turned avidly to his own contribution.
Then Barbara sent for me to help her receive
our guests.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This first of many receptions might have been arranged,
I thought, as a review of all that the war had left
us. Barbara stood at the stair-head in a white shawl of
Chinese silk, with flamingoes in flight and a deep fringe
sweeping to the scarlet heels of her white shoes. One
shoulder, miraculously whiter than the shawl, was bare; a
high comb of dark tortoise-shell proclaimed the astonishing
fairness of her skin; and in the soft light of the
chandelier her deep-set eyes shone like huge sapphires.
I stopped in stupefaction to realize that this was my wife;
and Barbara, reading my thoughts, coloured softly and
pressed my hand. As our guests came self-consciously
up the stairs, I saw one after another checking in the
same bewilderment; and Raymond Stornaway supplied
the image that was eluding me when he exclaimed:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A wand! A wand! You sweet child, with a wand in
your hand you’d be the fairy queen I fell in love with at
my first pantomime, fifty years before you were born.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>As I had taken little part in sending out the invitations,
I have only an indistinct memory of all who came. A
phalanx of perpetually disapproving relations gave place
to a battalion of my old Admiralty colleagues, headed by
Hornbeck; new young diplomats, representing yet
younger, newer states, raised Barbara’s hand ceremoniously
to their lips; <span class='it'>débutantes</span> of a generation after mine
pressed under the elbows of old family friends, who
blocked the traffic while they retailed trivial anecdotes of
my wife’s or my infancy. Here and there I saw an
actress, whose name in private life always eluded me;
time and again I uttered or received a warning against
‘the world’s worst bore’. I remember being introduced,
after frantic, whispered explanations, to innumerable authors
in tortoise-shell-rimmed spectacles. In my turn, I
remember introducing to Barbara the lost political sheep
whom she was to charm back into their fold.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I didn’t know there were so many people in the
<span class='it'>world</span>!,” she exclaimed in one of the few brief lulls.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Raymond Stornaway overheard her and sighed:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s the summer and autumn without the spring.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>As the brief lull ended, my thoughts went back to the
morning of Armistice Day when I paused on my way
home from the Admiralty to reckon how many of my
own generation had survived the war. As Robson bent,
straightened himself and turned at the stair-head, I expected
at every moment to hear him calling out “Captain
Dainton” or “Lord Loring” or “Mr. Arden”; had I
shut my eyes to their absence, I could have fancied that
we were living in 1914. Now, as then, Crawleigh was
so much engrossed in a political altercation with Bertrand
that he walked stormily into the drawing-room without
noticing us; Sam Dainton trotted up grinning—as usual—and
whispering scandal into Violet Loring’s reluctant
ear; Sir Roger, waiting uneasily for his wife, was mistaken—as
usual—for a hired waiter and urged to tell
John Gaymer where he could get his usual drink.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The last time I did this sort of thing was at my
coming-of-age ball,” Barbara murmured.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Which you gave for yourself because no one would
give it for you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, I hated father’s friends; and he hated mine,”
she laughed. “Besides, I’d been in so many scrapes that
I <span class='it'>had</span> to see whether people would continue to know
me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They all came,” I said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Except one. That was the time when Jack Waring
proposed to me one day and quarrelled with me the next,”
she explained lightly. “Why he wanted to marry me
when he disapproved of everything I did .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I invited
him specially.” .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And he wouldn’t come?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No. Apparently .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Eric isn’t coming .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. to-night.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The announcement fell so tranquilly, it was so long
since we had mentioned Eric Lane’s name that I doubted
for a moment if I had heard her aright.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. invited him?,” I asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes. Sonia and David were dining with him; and
I told David to bring him. You don’t mind? I wanted
to be friends. Ah .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.!” The sound was painfully like
a sob; but, when I turned, I saw Barbara smiling eagerly
as the O’Ranes came—unaccompanied—up the stairs.
“Take David where he won’t be trampled on,” she whispered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I was glad of a moment’s respite after the unintended
shock which Barbara had given me. Eric had left too
deep a mark on her spirit to be quickly forgotten; but I
fancied, when her old exuberant joy in life returned, that
she was no longer missing him. An hour before, I had
been stupefied to realize that Barbara was my wife; now
I wondered how much she was my wife. Not all her
thoughts were mine; was all her affection? I was
checked, by some question from O’Rane, on the verge of
a shameful jealousy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You want to know who’s here?” I looked down on
a seething mass of heads. “It would be easier to say
who’s not. Generally speaking, any one who was too old
or too young for the war; and a sprinkling of people with
charmed lives. The summer and winter without the
spring, Raymond calls it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It was a slaughter and a half!,” O’Rane muttered.
“If you calculate, among your own friends, the families
who’ve been left without a direct heir .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, Bertrand will tell you the old aristocracy is done
for. I don’t know. It weathered the industrial revolution
and the Napoleonic wars.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The shock was more gradual; there was a greater
power of resistance. Now the big estates are breaking
up; and the great masses are becoming conscious of their
strength.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>As I looked down the stairs, Crawleigh and Bertrand
were finishing their altercation. I heard Raymond telling
them that it was time for old men to be in bed; and the
phrase reminded me of my meeting with Saltash. In
every sense of the term, they were old men, no longer able
to hold their own against the young vigour of Saltash’s
recruits; in any struggle of class with class, the material
ammunition had passed from their hands. Their prestige
was weakening before the pressure of those who excelled
them in everything but length of tradition; and that tradition
was now being cut short.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I suppose you can call yourself a radical and still
believe in the value of a good strain in breeding,” I said.
“That hard-worked creature ‘the historian of the future’
will <span class='it'>have</span> to say, I suppose, that the people of this
country carried a heavier burden than any other in the
war? I <span class='it'>think</span> he’ll say that, of all our people, those who
carried the heaviest burden were the leaders. In fighting,
in directing, in paying .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. And in being killed: that’s
why there are so few of them here to-night. We shall be
the poorer if we lose that strain.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’ll hope there are still enough of them left to
carry it on,” said O’Rane.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The next few years will be a race; there’ll be a fight
against time, to spread the tradition before the people
who maintain it are swallowed up.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>We talked at random until Sonia came to collect him
for another party.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m sorry we couldn’t bring Eric,” I heard him say to
Barbara on leaving. “Some friend of his had a first
night; and he’d promised to look in.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Did he say if he was coming on?,” asked Barbara.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I should think it depends on the time. There was
some talk about a supper-party afterwards.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then I don’t suppose he will,” she answered with the
composure of complete indifference. “Good-night, David.
Good-night, Sonia.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>When we were by ourselves, I sent the servants to bed;
and we sat for half-an-hour discussing the party.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Half-past one,” she sighed at last. “Nobody <span class='it'>can</span> be
coming now.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If any one does,” I said, “he’ll find an excellent doorstep
to sit on. Come to bed, Babs.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I must write one letter first. You go on and turn
out the lights. If you see my torch, you might put it
on the hall-table.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I chose a book and went to my room. Only when I
was in bed did I discover that I had brought the wrong
book; and, on going downstairs again, I saw the lights
in the hall blazing. Then, as I reached the drawing-room,
I caught sight of Barbara, seated in a high-backed chair
at the stair-head. At first I thought she was asleep; then
I saw that she was staring through the hall to the front
door.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is anything the matter?” I asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He <span class='it'>can’t</span> be coming now,” she answered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Who? Eric?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>My earlier whisperings of jealousy were silenced by her
utter forlornness. I did not care whether her thoughts
and affection and heart and soul were his, so long as I
could take the look of pain out of her eyes. I wanted to
tell her that I understood and was sorry for her; but the
name had roused her, and she stood up with languid
dignity:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes.” .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. She was once again the alert and vigilant
hostess of an hour before. “I thought it would
look so terribly rude if he came here and found no one
to receive him. After I’d specially asked him, too,” she
added on a higher note. Then her self-possession returned
to her. “It’s two o’clock. As he hasn’t come
now, I suppose .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. he’s not coming .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. at all.” .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<h3>4</h3>

<p class='pindent'>If “the historian of the future”, whom I have already
invoked, have the microscopic vision and the titanic industry
with which his predecessors credit him, I believe
he must find space for a footnote, in brilliant, to describe
our share in forming a critical opposition during the last
four months of the armistice. In the days immediately
following the 1918 election, the government had hardly
an enemy; in the months after the peace-treaty was signed,
it had hardly a friend. Even before the <span class='it'>Economic Consequences
of the Peace</span>, even before the mutual vituperation
of the allies, an independent mood of questioning
and doubt succeeded to the hysterical assertions and demands
of the mad election. How far we fostered that
mood by means of open propaganda and private suggestion,
how far we made articulate a frame of mind that
was already struggling to express itself, I cannot say;
but that the mood became contagious cannot be challenged.
In these first spring days, Barbara’s circumspect cousin,
Lord John Carstairs, avoided our house for fear of finding
himself described as a ‘defeatist’, a friend of the
enemy, a creature of Caillaux or a hireling of Stinnes.
By the end of the summer, an alert opportunist such as
Sir Rupert Foreditch sought publicity in the columns of
<span class='it'>Peace</span> or opened his campaign by an attack on Seymour
Street because our paper was frank and fearless and because
“the Oakleigh gang”, as we were unflatteringly
called, was too important and, in time, too numerous to
be ignored.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On the morrow of the inaugural dinner, Bertrand
hunted me out of doors to study “the great movement
of men”, while he plotted with Barbara new days of
keeping me on the run. No reference was made to our
pitiful encounter at the stair-head; but I left a note to
say that she was not to be called, and, when I carried in
her breakfast, she looked up—with the eloquent silence
of a dog—to thank me for understanding and to shew
that she too understood. At once, after that, she began
to discuss the party of the night before.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I am not going to pretend that my work for the next
three years, though it left me without an hour, a house
or a wife to call my own, was void of interest: duty compelled
me to meet every one, from labour-leaders to cabinet
ministers and from editors to bishops, who might
be thought to influence action or opinion by a hair’s
breadth; I had to read the new books and absorb a mass
of papers; I explored different parts of the country to
find what different classes were saying or thinking; and
a New York reporter could not have been quicker to lay
hands on the foreign bankers and diplomats who passed
through London. Two or three dinner-parties were given
in each week to these unofficial missionaries; I met my
uncle daily at the Eclectic Club to pool our discoveries
in collective psychology; and on Wednesday nights the
staff of <span class='it'>Peace</span> assembled on their spurious Sheraton
chairs and helped to hammer out a new message to mankind.</p>

<p class='pindent'>If from time to time I harboured unworthy projects
for desertion, my weakness of purpose must be attributed
to natural indolence and perhaps justifiable impatience.
Our progress seemed so lamentably slow; our aims were
so exasperatingly vague! Much as I valued Bertrand’s
long experience, greatly as I admired his flashes of intuition,
I dreaded his descents on Fetter Lane in these first
discouraging months. From Sir Philip Saltash or from
the spirit of the age he had caught an itch for supermen;
and I went about my work with a shame-faced consciousness
of inadequacy while my uncle clasped his hands over
his stick and boomed oracularly of novel tendencies and
strange expedients.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’re becoming precious,” he grunted unamiably
at our second number. “Average opinion; the common
touch: you mustn’t neglect that, George. If you take
your friend Dainton as a barometer .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And I was incontinently pricked into the least comfortable
of my clubs, where I tested average feelings as
they were represented in the changing utterances of one
well-meaning and uniquely stupid legislator. The first
experiment was made at a time when the successful
candidates of the December election were uneasily hoping
to be saved by the firmness and idealism of President
Wilson from the consequences of their less temperate
speeches.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Wilson <span class='it'>le bienvenu</span>’,” Dainton murmured approvingly,
as he laid down a welcoming number of <span class='it'>Punch</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A few weeks later, I found the French press excitedly
proclaiming that Germany was being let off too easily.
Sir John Woburn demanded with all the polyphonic energy
of the Press Combine why America should be allowed
to deprive the allies of their just reparations; and
Dainton assured me profoundly that the task of winning
the war was child’s play compared with that of winning
the peace.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Damned obstinate fellow, Wilson,” he grumbled.
“If he thinks we’re going to let him throw away all that
our gallant boys fought for, he’ll have a rude awakening.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Later still, he ceased to speak of the president altogether.
Remembering Limehouse, he could not give implicit
trust to the prime minister; but the gossip that
floated from Paris to London convinced him that M.
Clemenceau was the only statesman in Europe and he
was content to leave himself in the hands of a man whose
rare, sardonic utterances embodied the ferocity which
Dainton had expressed so much less concisely in his
election speeches. Members of parliament, he told me,
had duties nearer home. Labour menaces were more
important than quibbles about frontiers: coal strikes and
railway strikes, both leading through nationalization and
civil war to ruin and the disruption of the empire, were
the proper study of political mankind. Sir Roger no
longer spoke of the British working-man as one of “our
gallant boys”; and I was invited to penetrate the disguise
that sheltered a Russian communist. Before I could
do justice to this conception, he had found new duties
even nearer to the hand of a patriot. “Bolshevism”
was bad, but it soon ceased, in Dainton’s eyes, to be quite
so bad as “profiteering”; and neither, by the middle of
the summer, was so exasperating nor so tenacious of
life as Irish irreconcilability.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If I could hold the wretched country under the sea
for five minutes!,” he exploded.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Fed on political catch-words and instructed by safe
cartoons, Sir Roger Dainton, coalition-unionist member
for the Crowley Division of Hampshire, would explain
Ireland on alternate days by reference to the incurable
dourness of the north and the ineradicable savagery of
the south. He was the ‘pendulum voter’, the representative
of all that is unstable, ill-informed and irresponsible
in public life. For that I was prepared; for that Bertrand
had sent me to study him. I was not prepared, however,
to be accepted as a disciple and an ally. Dining weekly
in Rutland Gate, I wondered whether the little man had
ever before found any one who would listen to him:
obviously, pathetically, he looked forward to our “good
pow-wows”; and, when he saw me to the door and gave
me a fresh cigar, still more when he said, “Then, next
Tuesday as usual?”, I felt that I was being sent back
to school with a sovereign in my hand and being invited
to Crowley for my next leave-out day. My embarrassment
was increased by a sense of black ingratitude. Sir
Roger always made these meetings “an occasion within
the meaning of the act”, as he called it, and opened his
best champagne for me. When Barbara deserted me on
the plea that we wanted to talk business and she would
be in the way, Dainton redoubled his hospitality and became
increasingly confused in speech. As I watched
the clock, I would ask myself how such a man was admitted
to the board of a company or tolerated in parliament;
then, in a flash of revelation, I saw him as the type
of all the class on which Sir Philip Saltash exercised the
wiles of his publicity. Saltash was a logical inference
from Dainton.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now you see why I told you to study him,” Bertrand
chuckled, when I announced that I would resign
my editorship before I submitted to another spell of Dainton’s
political conversation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In despair, I asked how our little office in Fetter Lane
was to overtake and undo the work of Saltash and his
forebears of the popular press. To this, however, my
uncle had no answer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Though he continued to speak of us as a chosen people,
our mission of enlightenment was established on a
paying basis by the success of our literary editors, who
made of <span class='it'>Peace</span> the most feared and least loved review in
London. As Hancock confined his criticism to novels
and Mattrick to poetry, they could not be charged with
rolling their own logs or obstructing a rival, though I
noticed that Mattrick’s sweeping condemnations stopped
short of “Mr. Hancock’s true lyrical genius” and Hancock’s
devastating onslaughts on modern fiction made
an exception in favour of Mr. Mattrick. My conscience
became unquiet when books were sent out for review and
I heard Hancock choosing critics who could be trusted
to “sit on this sort of rot”; but, as the “rot” was usually
written by men who seemed to be making a substantial
income, I hoped that they could afford an occasional
attack and console themselves with the knowledge
that, in the Penmen’s Club, fifty yards away, a league of
disgruntled novelists and poets was plotting the destruction
of “the Hancock-Mattrick gang”.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All the same,” Bertrand expostulated after a month
or two, “we’re not running this paper so that one ill-tempered
young gentleman can read what another ill-tempered
young gentleman has said about a book he
hasn’t troubled to finish. We’re not in touch yet with
opinion. You don’t mix with enough people, George:
it’s all the office, or the club, or Barbara’s parties.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But where am I to find your new men?,” I asked.
“You say politics are no longer manufactured over a
week-end party at Woburn. The political clubs only
harbour your Tapers and Tadpoles. Where do men like
Saltash and Wister and Foreditch do their work?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They take their pleasure at the Turf and Stage,”
Bertrand answered sourly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m dining there with the O’Ranes to-night,” I said,
as we began to walk home.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then you’ll probably meet them. New men, new
meeting-places.” My uncle laughed mirthlessly. “If
Pam or Johnnie Russell .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. It’s the rising tide of
democracy. Agricultural depression and death duties
have slowly strangled the landed classes; their social influence
is tottering. Before the war, Asquith was almost
the only prime minister, bar Dizzy, who wasn’t
drawn from them; but the prime ministers of the future
will come from the middle class .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. till they come from
labour. And the stage changes with the actors,” he continued
in a deep rumble that carried from the one side
of Fleet Street to the other. “<span class='it'>Circumspice!</span> When the
masses had been taught to read, Newnes gave them <span class='it'>Tit-Bits</span>;
Pearson and Harmsworth followed with the cheap
daily press; headlines took the place of news and arguments.
The focus shifts to the newspaper office.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>We were passing a flamboyant, white-and-gold building
described as a “Super Electric Palace de Luxe”; and I
asked Bertrand if he thought pictures were coming to
take the place of headlines.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s not the instrument that matters, but the man
who handles it,” he answered. “Does Saltash play on
Ll-G. or does Ll-G. play on Saltash? You’ll know better
to-night when you’ve seen the new stage with the new
men on it. Your modern prime minister doesn’t waste
his time with duchesses at Ross House or with dukes at
the Carlton. He has suave young secretaries to feed
the press; he has rich friends to provide him personally
with the sinews of war. He has his publicity agent.
And, if he’s wise, he has a chain of intermediaries running
through the country, somebody always knowing
somebody who knows somebody else, so that he can draw
any one into his net at a moment’s notice.” As we crossed
Waterloo Place, Bertrand glanced contemptuously at Mr.
Gladstone’s old house in Carlton House Terrace.
“There’d be no end to the buzzing if Ll-G. spent a week-end
with Sir John Woburn: he <span class='it'>must</span> be trying to collar
the Press combine! But if my Lord Lingfield entertains
a few actresses and a jockey or two and a prize-fighter
and if Woburn happens to come along .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.? That’s
how politics are manufactured nowadays; and the Turf
and Stage is the sort of place to see them manufacturing.”</p>

<h3>5</h3>

<p class='pindent'>Such a preparation was almost inevitably a preparation
for disappointment; but the unexpected end of my first
evening at the Turf and Stage left me no time to define
my expectations nor judge whether they had been fulfilled.
As Barbara had a headache, I entered the resplendent
club-room off Hanover Square under Sonia’s protection;
and, for all the scars that the last five years had left, I
could have fancied for a moment that we were back in
1914 when the “Cottage Cabaret” and “Blue Moon”
were tentatively opening their doors. I observed the same
mirrored walls and plush sofas, the same small tables
surrounding the same polished floor, the same high gallery
and beaming, southern band. From the atmosphere
I inhaled the same desolating quality, only to be rendered
by the desolating name of “smartness”.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I found no hint, however, that my rigidly standardized
neighbours were powers behind thrones. Apart from a
passion for dancing that grew ever more feverish as
youth receded, they were severely domesticated. Men
brought their wives to supper, I was told, their sisters
to dinner and their mothers to luncheon; I should not
have been surprised to hear of a nursery upstairs or to
see Gaspard, the incomparable manager, devising quiet
games with the children in their parents’ absence. Most
of the men that night were young and exceedingly prosperous
financiers; the rest, exemplified by Laurence Hunter-Oakleigh
and Johnnie Gaymer, had at least the appearance
of prosperity. Born to rule, they had all done
well in the war; they were doing well in the peace; and
their women dominated the situation as shrewdly, as
calmly and as confidently as the men. Some trick of
memory sent my thoughts back to the “Duchess of Richmond”
ball at Loring Castle on the eve of the war. I
remembered standing in the hall with Puggy Mayhew,
watching the lithe girls and hard-trained men mounting
the stairs with their magnificently English self-possession;
and, though Mayhew filled a grave in Mesopotamia,
I could hear again his tone of startled discovery as he
murmured: “There’s nothing to touch them in any country
<span class='it'>I</span> know.” .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I had been invited to meet a girl who aspired to that
career of mendicancy and private blackmail which is
known to women with a friend in Fleet Street as “freelance
journalism”; and, while O’Rane waited in the hall
for the rest of his party, Sonia led me downstairs for
a cocktail.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have a standing invitation from Gaspard to come
here at his expense,” she confided. “He considers me
rather a draw. And, as Lorrimer is always good for a
dress if I’ll wear it in public, I can usually kill two guests
with one free dinner. If Johnnie Gaymer would only
give me one of his firm’s cars to be seen driving
about in, David would get a perfectly good wife below
cost.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>As we descended to a more intimate room, with smaller
tables half hidden by plates of oysters, I suggested that
the assistant-almoner of the Lancing millions could afford
to buy his wife a car.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then you don’t know David,” she rejoined with a
touch of petulance. “He’s working himself to death;
but, if any one tries to pay him for what he does, he
thinks it’s charity. Let’s talk of something else. You’ve
not met this Maitland child? She’s very pretty and very
silly, I should think. Just what I was at her age .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. or
at my own, I suppose you’d say if I gave you a chance.
Finished? Then let’s go up,” she continued with the
restlessness that characterized the age or at least the women
of it whom I met that night.</p>

<p class='pindent'>One and all, they sat down and jumped up again like
marionettes that would collapse if their wires slackened;
they looked at one page of a paper and then tossed it
away; they clamoured for cigarettes and laid them aside.
Finding that her other guests were not yet arrived, Sonia
hurried into the dining-room, snatched a youth unknown
to me from his protesting party and danced with him
till a voice, peevish with hunger, cried: “Bertie, you little
beast, come back and order dinner.” She then attached
herself precariously to another party, stole some one else’s
portion of caviare and rejoined us in the hall with her
booty.</p>

<p class='pindent'>O’Rane, I thought, was looking ill and overworked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Stornaway’s gone down with pneumonia,” he explained;
“so I’ve had all his work to do. It’s a bigger
thing than I contemplated. I wonder .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I wonder
very much .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Whether you can carry out the schemes we discussed
at Cannes?,” I asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No! Whether we’ve any place in our present civilization
for these colossal fortunes .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Ah, that’s Ivy’s
voice. Come and be introduced.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I have never known for certain who constituted our
party that night. Four of us met in the hall; but we mislaid
Sonia as we went to our table; and John Gaymer
invited himself to join us until his own friends arrived.
Between the dances, some twenty to forty people surged
into our corner; during them, I was usually left with
one compassionate neighbour. As in a dream, I talked
to O’Rane with grave absorption about shell-shock treatment;
then I listened as Sam Dainton was convinced
against his will that he had spent the previous night in
the hall of his hotel, because he could not remember his
bedroom number nor his name; then Sonia plunged me
in a morass of domestic finance, demanding how any one
could keep herself, her husband and child on the pittance
which David allowed her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And now I’m going to have another,” she added, as
the saxophone uttered a warning bleat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dance?,” I asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, baby, of course.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Do knock some sense into
David’s head.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Good-bye-ee.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>As she slipped away, I found myself alone with a
pretty little dark-eyed girl, precocious and unbalanced,
whom I remembered with difficulty as Ivy Maitland; and
for another five minutes we talked gravely of work and
life and careers for women. Ivy must have been younger
by several years than any other woman in the club; and
in that setting she seemed a human note of interrogation,
scored by the present on the threshold of the future. She
also seemed sadly out of place. Her friends were too
old for her, most of them were married, some were living
apart from their wives and others were not living
far enough apart from the wives of other men.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At the end of five minutes, forgetting her concern for
a career, she darted off to dance with John Gaymer; and
her place was taken by Sam Dainton, lately returned from
Paris and full of gossip about the conference. The unruffled
Gaspard conjured one more chair to our ever-lengthening
table; and a basket of plover’s eggs for Sam
appeared simultaneously with O’Rane’s chicken and my
savoury, while heated revellers lolled over chair-backs
with coffee and cigarettes. A warning of indigestion
assailed me as I changed my place for the fourth
time; intellectual dyspepsia had prostrated me from the
moment when these five-minute conversational turns
began.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You look a bit out of the picture, old son,” Sam told
me candidly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m a spectator,” I said. “My uncle feels that I
should study the great movement of men.” .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Paris is the spot for that,” he chuckled, with his
mouth full. “They call it a peace conference, but I
should say it was a full-dress parade for the next
war.” .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He broke off as Sonia danced up with shining eyes
to whisper her discovery that one of our neighbours had
married a second husband in the premature belief that
the first had been killed. By the time she had done, Sam
had finished his plover’s eggs and was in the thick of a
discussion with my cousin Laurie, which was to enrich
them both if they could only find an out-of-work capitalist
to launch them. Ivy concluded an audible disagreement
with Gaymer, who I thought was more sodden than
his wont, and dragged me headlong into a conversation
that seemed to begin as startling indecency and cooled to
the temperate obscurity of psychoanalysis.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You should read Freud,” she told me. “Psychoanalysis
explains everything. You <span class='it'>are</span> behind the times.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>From the little knowledge which I had been compelled
to acquire in the hope of understanding the novels and
plays of the period, I should have said that psychoanalysis
defiled more than it explained; but I was chiefly interested
to distinguish this night as the first on which the old
reticences between men and women were torn away.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not bored, I hope?,” murmured a voice at my elbow,
as Ivy flitted away for the second time.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I turned to see O’Rane sitting huddled with fatigue.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Bewildered, rather. This .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. this is the generation
you’re undertaking to educate,” I said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You must expect some kind of reaction.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s been going on for six months now.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. However,
I’m more concerned with the shepherds than with
the sheep.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was only as the theatres emptied that I appreciated
my uncle’s sardonic wisdom in sending me to study “the
great movement of men” in the Turf and Stage. The
government was then represented by Lord Lingfield, who
danced—for exercise rather than pleasure—with Miss
Maud Valance, of the Pall Mall Theatre, and by the Right
Honourable Wilmot Dean, who refrained from dancing
on the principle that a man must learn to walk before
he can run and must be in a condition to stand before
he can dance. What weight Mr. Dean and Lord Lingfield
contributed to cabinet councils I am too ignorant to
guess; at the Turf and Stage they demonstrated that
ministers, in spite of a nonconformist head, were not killjoys;
and those who did not get many chances of hailing
convivial privy councillors by their Christian names took
the opportunity when it came.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s about twenty-one years since Gladstone died,”
I murmured to O’Rane. “It’s ‘new men, new manners’,
with a vengeance.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>In strident conversation with Wilmot Dean, I could
hear ‘Blob’ Wister roaring the latest of his political
creeds. For three months he had won consequence by
purchasing in succession the <span class='it'>People’s Tribune</span>, the <span class='it'>St.
Stephen’s Times</span> and the <span class='it'>Daily Echo</span>. No one knew
whence the money had been collected; no one that I ever
met could tell me whence Wister himself sprang. He
burst upon London like Sir Philip Saltash, like Wilmot
Dean, like a third of the new men inside the government
and on its outskirts, in response to the prime minister’s
known desire for business talent. I was still watching
the unsteady antics of Lingfield, when Sir Philip Saltash
himself rose with a well-remembered lurch and bore down
on us with the customary unlighted cigar swinging like
a semaphore from the one side of his mouth to the other.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come to inspect my bunch?,” he enquired, with a
careless nod and a less careless scrutiny of our liqueurs.
Then, as I hesitated for an answer: “You’re too dam’
superior for these times. When you’ve been in the game
as long as I have .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Funny thing! The first slogan
I ever heard in the States was that politics was not a
job for a gentleman; ten years later I heard it in Canada;
I’ve heard it in Australia; and, from what I’ve seen of
your rag, you’re sighing for the great days of Salisbury
and Pitt and all that lot.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I should hardly expect to find them here,” I said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They wouldn’t be in a state to come here! Old Pitt
was a rare one for the booze. People don’t change much.
You remember the old Limehouse days? Lloyd-George
said that an aristocracy was like old cheese; and the aristocracy
answered that Lloyd-George was a dirty little
Welsh attorney: ‘Oh, how <span class='it'>vulgar</span>!,’ you cried. Was
that worse than your old Salisbury’s nicknaming Joey
Chamberlain ‘Jack Cade’?” He looked round with a
fuddled but tolerant smile, as a miller might look when his
wheel stopped suddenly, at the corner where startling
silence had fallen on the conspiratorial, closely grouped
heads of Dean, Wister and Lingfield. “The war
opened up a place in the sun for people who hadn’t been
brought up to your kid-glove ideas of public life.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The whispering group was joined by Sir Rupert Foreditch,
whose chief claim on his country’s gratitude is
that he sacrificed the dilatory chance of promotion on the
staff in order to race home after Neuve Chapelle and offer
himself for a place in the first coalition. It was by an
accident of geography rather than through any lack of
zeal that others were before him; but he and the group
that broke the first war-administration have the comfort
of knowing that all decisions at the Dardanelles were
postponed till an embarrassed government could decide
which of their willing swords must be declined.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Would you say,” I asked, “that there was a touch
of the adventurer about some of them?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A man,” enunciated Saltash, “is only an adventurer
till he arrives; then he’s a pioneer. Nobody minds new
men when they’re like Asquith. Nobody minds rich men
when they’re like Derby.” .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“For one reason, because the Stanleys don’t drift
from one country to another, seeing which they can turn
to their own greatest profit.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Saltash shook his head incredulously:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t try to pull any stake-in-the-country stuff on
me. That’s well enough for your father-in-law. I sat
next to old Crawleigh at a city dinner last week; and he
didn’t know what to make of things. I did. And I
told him. ‘The aristocracy,’ I said, ‘has been swamped
by the middle-classes. Well, if the aristocracy couldn’t
keep its end up against men like Chamberlain and Asquith
and Lloyd-George, it was best out of the way.’ D’you
mind if I bring Foreditch over here? He’s just back
from Germany; and I want to know how the land lies
there.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I could not repel such a man at a time when my sole
function in the Turf and Stage was to study the new
leaders in our political life. When I first met Sir Rupert
at Oxford, he was an unbending radical; but the 1906
election brought into the world more radical mouths than
there was bread to feed, and, when I took my seat, Foreditch
was spaciously enthroned in the wastes of opposition.
As a hired assassin, his tale of Budget Leaguers’
scalps won him the deputy-leadership of the Die-Hards
when the Parliament Bill came to be fought; and, in the
Home Rule controversy, he preached rebellion in Ulster
with a gusto not exceeded by Mr. Bonar Law, Sir Edward
Carson and Mr. F. E. Smith. An incautious declaration
that the kaiser could be trusted to save Ulster from a
false Hanoverian, as William of Orange had saved her
from a perfidious Stuart, kept Foreditch from reaping the
reward of his shell-intrigue in 1916; but, if he missed
cabinet rank, he achieved a greater position as the unofficial
plenipotentiary who was always being sent, with
the easy informality introduced by a ‘business’ government,
to make overtures and arrange deals. His ambition,
I think, was to play the part of Colonel House
to Mr. Lloyd-George’s President Wilson: in the last
years of the war he was always vanishing mysteriously
to Stockholm or Berne; and, two years after this date,
I heard that he was visiting, in disguise, the leaders of
all the parties in Ireland.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The present condition of Germany .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.,” he began;
but, before I could hear what it was, an unknown woman
bustled up to our table and began to make notes for an
article which informed the world two days later (1) that
anybody who was anybody would be found dining at the
Turf and Stage, (2) that “Lucile”—as she confided to
her “darling Betty”—had seen good-looking Bobbie
Pentyre dancing with Lady Clackmannan’s girl, (3) that
Lady Barbara Oakleigh—“Babs Neave, as we must
still think of her”—had been at the table next to “Lucile’s”
and (4) that her husband would certainly stand
again for parliament when opportunity offered. In its
slangy pertness and familiarity, the style was the woman;
and, as accuracy was less important to the <span class='it'>Daily Picture</span>
than snappy diction or a knowing air of intimacy, it
would have been idle to correct her statements or to reprove
her manners. No doubt she had a livelihood to
earn; and those who create a demand have to bear as
heavy a responsibility as those who furnish the supply.
When I had recovered from my first exasperation, I felt
that the loud-voiced lady was less to blame than “Blob”
Wister, who owned the paper for which she wrote, and
the two million readers (the circulation of the <span class='it'>Daily Picture</span>
was certified by an impeccable firm of chartered accountants)
who liked to think of Miss Murchison as
“Lady Clackmannan’s girl” and of Lord Pentyre as
“Bobbie”. Those who had no chance of seeing for
themselves whether he was good-looking must have been
grateful to “Lucile” for lifting a corner of the curtain
from the world of beauty, rank and fashion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Another section of the public you propose to educate,”
I told O’Rane.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And you,” he retorted. “You heard what Sam Dainton
said about the state of Paris. Everybody hating
everybody else.” .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I looked round to make sure that we were not being
overheard. Lucien de Grammont, I knew, was somewhere
in the room; but I fancied that he was avoiding me.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s only these damned French,” I said. “Instead
of thanking us for pulling them out of the mire,
they think <span class='it'>they</span> won the war single-handed and our job
is just to foot the bill. Hang it all, Raney, we spent more
money and provided more ammunition than any one else;
we raised about five million men; we stayed on to clear
the Germans out of France when it was all we could do
to keep the French in the war at all; and, when our papers
were gushing about the splendid unity, the French government
was making us pay rent for the trenches our
men occupied to defend their miserable country. They’re
the meanest hounds on earth. During the war, one
couldn’t say these things .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Does one do much good by saying them now? The
Americans bring pretty much the same charge against
us. You’ve an organization, George, and you should
make it your business to fight the hatred-epidemic.” .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He broke off, as the bland Gaspard presented himself
at our table with the announcement that a lady was waiting
outside. When I read Yolande Manisty’s name, I
guessed that Raymond Stornaway was worse; when I
met her, I knew—without being told—that he was
dead. As I came back to the blaze and blare of the dining-room,
I felt that this was my first contact with reality
that night. The financiers and wire-pullers and propagandists,
the glittering <span class='it'>corps de ballet</span>, the punctual scribe
who chronicled their movements, all belonged to a world
of masquerade. I cannot say what lesson Bertrand had
sent me there to learn; the lesson which I carried away
was a doubt—the first since 1914—of victory.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I drove O’Rane to his house in Westminster and left
him to think over Yolande Manisty’s message. By the
terms of her uncle’s will, he had—for better or for worse—inherited
unconditionally an estate of more than twenty
million pounds.</p>

<h3>1</h3>

<p class='pindent'>Those who had never before heard of Sir Aylmer
Lancing or of Deryk are no more likely than I am to
forget the excitement of the week that followed Raymond
Stornaway’s death. That it lasted no more than a week
was due to the number of competing claims on the public
attention; but, between the Bloomsbury cocaine-prosecution
and the Dawlish murder, half the papers were
calling O’Rane’s heritage “romantic” and the other half
“sensational”, while the conversation at every dinner-party
that I attended came by divers ways to the unanimous
conclusion that Sonia would now spend twelve
hundred thousand pounds a year on feeding her friends.
Before she had recovered from her first shock, I observed
that she was considering bigger houses in other parts of
London; on the morrow, when I dined—for the last
time, as I vowed to myself—in Rutland Gate, Lady
Dainton told me that she had never entertained any idea
of selling Crowley Court; and, when I visited O’Rane
to enquire if he needed help, he shewed me a pile, waist-high,
of begging letters.</p>

<h3>2</h3>

<p class='pindent'>It was my first visit to the offices of the Lancing Trust;
and I retain the memory of a vast, wind-swept barn on
the edge of Hampstead Heath, with an old red-brick cottage
and pent-houses of tarred wood attached. There
were a great many box-files, a gigantic set of loose-leaf
ledgers, a fair-sized reference library and a large number
of typewriters. On one wall I recognized the map which
Aylmer Lancing used to keep in his study to remind him
of the stages by which his grip had spread over the earth’s
surface. In all other respects, the building might have
belonged to a poor-law relieving-officer; and Sonia, who
obviously expected to find a double row of bankers smoking
long cigars at a gleaming mahogany table, was no less
obviously disappointed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I came to see if I could help you in any way,” I told
O’Rane, who had rather frightened me the night before
by his air of physical exhaustion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We found him now with one of his secretaries in
Raymond Stornaway’s private office, fidgeting with the
will. I learned that the money was to be spent “for the
good of humanity”; and in the construction of that clause
he had already received so much contradictory advice that
he had closed his office to chance callers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I didn’t expect Stornaway to die so soon,” was all
he would say when I asked him his plans.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I doubt if time will make your problem any easier,”
I answered, as I joined Sonia in front of the tattered
wall-map.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There, from the centre of what Lancing had bought as
a burnt-out town-site, the Lancing influence spread in
extending circles. A name and date in faded ink marked
the advance of his railroads, the acquisition of his forests
and mines, the linking of lake to ocean for the transportation
of his grain. Dotted lines, leading to vague infinity,
shewed where Lancing had splashed out of the union into
the Atlantic, the Pacific and the Gulf of Mexico.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You must move to a decent office,” Sonia put in.
“And we can’t go on at The Sanctuary if you want to
entertain properly. People will expect us to live up to our
position, you know.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>O’Rane smiled grimly as he ushered us compellingly
to the door.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Whether that’s for the good of humanity .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.,” he
murmured.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After this single meeting I resolved not to break in
on his contemplation until I was invited. Very soon my
attention was to be claimed by troubles of my own, for
I was not satisfied with the state of Barbara’s mind or
body; I, too, wanted to think; and, though I treated
O’Rane to an unsolicited misgiving whenever I remembered
his new estate, I will not pretend that I thought of
him much after the feverish seven days in which every
one I met said: “You’ve heard about it, of course?
That’s the sort of thing that <span class='it'>would</span> happen to Sonia.
What d’you suppose they’ll do with it?” .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was in these days that the last touches were being
given to the great peace-treaty which was to make an
end of war; and, but for that, I should have handed Bertrand
my resignation and taken Barbara abroad. Until
we saw the terms, however, we could not tell how far his
gloomy predictions at Cannes would be fulfilled nor how
far any one could undo the mischief that was reported
from Paris. If we could believe a quarter of all we heard,
the butchery for which Sanguszko and Boscarelli clamoured
in Lucien’s verandah-parliament was taking place
in one country after another; as I warned Saltash, three
discontented Alsace-Lorraines were being created for one
that was pacified; and the mood of the December election
seemed to return as the public realized the helplessness
of the defeated enemy. Outside the now notorious “Oakleigh
gang” I found few to admit that any country but
Germany had been responsible for the war; and on that
foundation each man erected his own standard of retribution.
My father-in-law went the length of collecting a
party at the Eclectic Club to reason with me and to check
the wrong-headed doctrines that poured forth, week after
week, from Fetter Lane.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You really seem to live in a world of your own,”
he explained wearily. “<span class='it'>I</span> don’t hope to convince you;
but, if you take a poll of your friends, on a question like
indemnities .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Before he had time to finish or I to answer, John
Carstairs put his own case with alluring brevity:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The Boche made the war. The Boche must pay for
it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What would have happened to our colonies if we’d
lost?,” pursued Crawleigh, who seemed to regard the
empire as a dumping-ground for the viceregally-inclined
members of his family. German West Africa was below
his dignity, but he had three sons. “These people mustn’t
complain if they’re served in the same way.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I recalled and quoted Bertrand’s dictum that no lasting
peace could be established on a sense of grievance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I feel no tenderness towards Germany,” I said, “but
aren’t we making another war inevitable?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You will make it inevitable,” said Mr. Justice Maitland,
“if you let the last war go unpunished. No one
will deny that the Germans broke a treaty, that they
robbed, tortured, violated and murdered, not in the heat
of fighting but as part of a terrorizing campaign ordered
from headquarters. If acts like these go unpunished,
every nation will know that it can take ‘frightfulness’
as its starting-point. Rape and mutilation will become
sanctified usages of war. There will be a precedent.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s unanswerable,” I told the judge. “But, if
this war proves anything, it proves that war doesn’t pay.
I want to make that the great contribution of this war
to history. If we impose a peace so unendurable that
even war is no worse .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Maitland interrupted me with a smiling head-shake:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have to try murderers in the course of my duties.
Their state would be no better than that of their victims,
if vendettas were permitted. You might say truly enough
that murder doesn’t pay. I should be sorry to see the
death-penalty abolished on that reasoning.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If you could hang every German,” I said, as I left
to dress for the opera, “I might accept your argument.
As it is, a punitive peace will set them thinking of revenge;
and, the moment they’re strong enough, they’ll
take it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A good reason for keeping them weak,” said Carstairs,
“which—quite rightly—is all Clemenceau cares
about.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I might have multiplied, almost to infinity, the number
of similar opinions, held by the most dissimilar people. I
heard them at the club, I was inundated by them at my
office and I wrestled with them at Barbara’s parties.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wonder whether Bertrand thinks we’re making any
headway?,” I asked that night at dinner, after venting
my despondency on my wife.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I am not sure whether she heard me; her only answer
was to look at her watch and to ask which opera was
being played.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Louise?</span>” she repeated. “Then we can miss the first
two acts. I suppose you wouldn’t care to go alone?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Aren’t you feeling up to it?,” I asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Barbara turned her back on me and busied herself with
the wad of her cigarette-holder:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I don’t know! Yes, I’m all right! And, anyway,
I shan’t do any good .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I don’t know what I’m
talking about!,” she cried with sudden loss of control.
“I’m going to lie down till we start.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll take you up,” I said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No!,” she answered, with what I can only call a suppressed
scream.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her look and tone took me aback as though she had
struck me in the face. For some weeks I had fancied
that her nerves were disordered; but, as I finished my
cigar in solitude, I felt that this night marked a subtle
change in my relations with her. To this day I cannot
tell when it began. We had been married little more than
a year; before that, for ten years, we had been excellent
friends. At first I believe she told me every thought
in her heart; and there were times when I wished for
both our sakes that she would think less and say less
about what could not be mended. As though I had put
my wish into words, her manner changed at the armistice:
we were to make a new start, she was to forget her love
for Eric Lane; and, after that, an onlooker would have
said that she belonged to me, soul and body. She and I
alone knew that, in some way, we were becoming
strangers. Though she was bored with Cannes after the
first week, she never told me; she might be bored with the
life of a political hostess, but loyalty or lack of confidence
kept her silent. She would not admit that she was ill or
unhappy; but something now tortured her beyond bearing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And I was afraid to ask her. In all that touched her
soul, I was a stranger, an amateur and a bungler. Something
of this must have revealed itself in my expression,
for on her return to the dining-room she put her arms
round my neck and told me not to look so worried.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m worried about you,” I said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But I swear to you I’ve never felt better in my life!
Come on; or we shall miss the only act worth hearing!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I followed her, more worried than ever. If I said
nothing, I should seem callous; if I said anything, I might
inflame her misery. I knew her too little for any idea
what she wanted of me; and she trusted me too little to
help by a hint. At this rate, she would become every
day more uncommunicative; and each unanswered appeal
for understanding would separate her farther from
me.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If <span class='it'>ever</span> there’s anything the matter,” I said, as we
got into the car, “I hope you’ll tell me, Babs.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Everything’s <span class='it'>perfect</span>,” she answered. “A darling
house, a darling husband.” .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Her voice suddenly lost
its false ring of assurance. “No, the fault’s in <span class='it'>me</span> somewhere.
There’s something missing. Don’t let’s talk
about it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>At the unexpected quaver, I caught her fingers in mine;
and she brushed away a tear with the back of my hand.
Though no more was said, I felt that something more
ought to have been said and that I was a moral coward
for not saying it. In the silence and darkness of the car,
I wondered whether Barbara was unhappy because she
had been given no sign that she was to bear children.
For all I knew, she did not want them or was afraid;
for all I knew, she wanted them and could not bear them
and was afraid to tell me. And we were both afraid to
confess our fear.</p>

<h3>3</h3>

<p class='pindent'>When we reached the opera-house, the second act was
over; and, on the way to our box, we ran the gauntlet
of a dozen friends, who invited us to meals, and of a
hundred staring strangers, who turned to their neighbours
and whispered: “There’s Lady Barbara!” with the
mingled triumph and awe which the English display when
they recognize any idol of the illustrated papers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“One gets used to anything, even the manners of the
well-bred,” I murmured, as we struggled towards the
stairs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If any one else asks us to lunch, I shall say we’ve
given up eating.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Oh, I <span class='it'>must</span> speak to Marion!
You go on.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I ploughed slowly into an open space by the entrance
to the pit-tier boxes, then came to an involuntary standstill.
Face to face, too near for either of us to escape,
I found Eric Lane smoking a cigarette and looking over
my shoulder to the place where Barbara was talking to
Mrs. Shelley. Unless she had already seen him and
was lingering behind till I had made myself a screen, they
must meet in another moment. Eric never had much
colour to lose, but even his lips now seemed bloodless.
When our eyes met, I could not have said which was
the more uncomfortable. I enquired after his father, I
believe; and he asked me, as he had been in Japan at
the time of our wedding, to accept his belated good wishes
now.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“When are we to have another play?,” I asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This autumn, I hope,” he answered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good for that. Well, Eric, I little thought in the
old Phoenix Club days that we were entertaining a
genius unawares.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They were g-good days,” he sighed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then there was a pause; and the cordiality which old
habit had brought to life wilted. As he glanced in Barbara’s
direction, I fancy he was charging her with making
our friendship impossible; this second sight of her
seemed to incapacitate him; and we stood stockishly silent.
When she joined us, there was, indeed, a smile
on either side, a high and rather breathless “Oh, how do
you do?” Then we hurried to our box; and Eric strolled
across the hall. His hand was shaking as he tried to relight
his cigarette; and the hollow eyes and cadaverous
cheeks seemed ten years older for the ten seconds’ encounter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Was it a presentiment of this meeting that had unnerved
Barbara? I had no time to speak before we
were surrounded by a new throng. It was her first appearance
at Covent Garden; and from the boxes and
stalls we had opera-glasses trained upon us until I seemed
to be looking at a tank of lobsters; a queue formed outside
our door and we were flattened against the side of
the box. The acclamation was not confined within a
ring of our friends: I felt the atmosphere of the whole
house warming in the greatest tribute to personality that
I have ever seen.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I watched you coming in to-night,” Dr. Gaisford
told her at the end. “It was like the sun breaking
through.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. How are you, my dear child? As you
don’t come to see me professionally, I hope that means
you’re well and happy?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Everything’s <span class='it'>perfect</span>,” Barbara cried, with a conviction
that had been lacking when she used the same words
earlier. As we settled ourselves in the car, she added
joyously: “How sweet every one is! Marion wants us
to choose a night for dining with her next week. And
I’ve committed you to the Pinto de Vasconcellos the
week after. And Bobbie Pentyre wants us to go to Croxton
one week-end. Can you remember all that? And
will you come?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Anywhere you like,” I promised. “You seem to
have had rather a success to-night, Babs.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s a good world! I’ve got back my grip on life.
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I feel <span class='it'>free</span>,” she went on with a note of wonder;
and her hand stole shyly into mine as though we were
composing a quarrel: “George dear, I’m sorry to have
been unsatisfactory, sorry to have worried you. I
promised on Armistice Day that I wouldn’t speak of certain
people. You can’t help thinking of them, but since
to-night I’m not .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. haunted. <span class='it'>Seeing</span> Eric has broken
the spell.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I can meet him now. I’m going to.
Madame Pinto said he was coming to her party.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Remembering Eric’s look of anguish when he caught
sight of Barbara, I felt that the greatest kindness she
could shew him would be to prevent further meetings.
It was folly, I thought, for her to invite him to our first
reception, it was madness to expect that he would come;
and, if I said nothing at the time, it was for fear she
would imagine that I was jealous.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Make things as easy as you can for him,” I recommended.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We can give him the opportunity of being friends
again.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And don’t be hurt if he doesn’t take it. Men of that
kind, imaginative and highly-strung .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. In his way,
he is a bit of a genius.” .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I gave him that,” she murmured with a pride which
I thought ill-timed. “He had only talent before.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>To judge by appearances, Eric had paid dearly for
his goddess’ kiss.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They feel things more intensely,” I continued, “than
dull, matter-of-fact people like me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Barbara made no answer for several minutes; then
she looked straight ahead and asked:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Wouldn’t you feel it as much if you lost me?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I should feel it more than anything in the world.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s broken Eric. He’ll never be mended. But it
wouldn’t break you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Faint though the challenge was, I fancied, for the first
time in my life, that Barbara was trying to drag me into
a ‘scene’.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We won’t talk about it,” I said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t think anything would break you. And you
may take that how you like.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The words may have been her tribute to flint-like
resolution or her criticism of wooden insensibility. The
way that I decided to take them was in silence. Barbara
hid her face in the great nosegay of carnations
which she always carried, then held them out, like an
impulsive child, for me to smell. As she walked, slender,
tall and radiant, into the house, I felt that this was the
day which I had waited fourteen months to see dawning.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, I had quite a success,” she murmured to her
reflection, when we paused in front of a mirror halfway
up the stairs. “You seem surprised, George.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t know how any one could hope to resist you,”
I said. “<span class='it'>I</span> never can.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The South American dinner to which Barbara had
committed me marked our grudging surrender to a lady
whose hospitality was rapidly breaking the <span class='it'>morale</span> of
London. Madame Pinto de Vasconcellos, if her ambitions
had been examined before the judgement-seat, must
have confessed a resolution to force free wine, food and
tobacco on a larger number of victims than had fallen
to any other Brazilian. Setting out with an introduction
to the Duchess of Ross and a system of snowball terrorization
for every one else, she secured B for her
parties by playing on his fear of hurting A’s feelings.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She is a stranger to London,” the duchess explained
to Lady Crawleigh in a tone that hid natural exultation
under less natural pity. “I should like to shew her a little
hospitality.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Lady Crawleigh had been caught too often in similar
traps to forget that, while Herrig Castle and Ross House
remained unlet, no one was secure; but, like every one
else, she tried to shelter herself behind a substitute.
Madame Pinto, she told Barbara, had heard so much of
her “beautiful daughter”; it would be only a kindness
to accept one of her many invitations.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When I pointed out that the whole English-speaking
world had heard so much of Barbara, my mother-in-law
rejoined wistfully that it was a small thing to ask, that
she did not ask much and that she would not have asked
now if she had imagined we should make difficulties.
Remembering the unsteady concordat which was the best
that a heretic and a radical could ever hope to establish
with the Crawleighs, I urged Barbara to capitulate before
I knew that Eric Lane was to be our fellow-guest. Had
I now urged her to refuse, Lady Crawleigh would have
had a grievance; and Barbara might have thought that
I had a personal interest in preventing another encounter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Though the dinner passed off pleasantly enough, it
had one wholly unexpected result which changed the
course of history for two or three of Madame Pinto’s
guests. Had we refused this invitation, I might not have
seen John Carstairs for another month; had I not seen
him, I should not have asked him to tell me about his
recent tour of the Ross estates in Connemara; had he
not told me, I might have contentedly played my part
of absentee landlord for years to come. Carstairs, however,
succeeded in frightening me with his stories of
impending Irish trouble. The precarious peace, he said,
might break down at any moment. As trustee for his
half-witted brother, he was anxious to sell at any sacrifice
and advised me to do the same. Whether I sold or
not, I should be a fool if I did not at least visit an estate
which I had neglected since the Easter rising of 1916.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Our chance conversation was the cause of my first
serious disagreement with Barbara. Before parting with
a property that had been in the family for three hundred
years, I told her that we must explore the conditions of
the County Kerry for ourselves. In my suggestion that
we should go to Lake House for Whitsuntide she acquiesced
at once, only stipulating that she should be allowed
to stay behind at the last moment if the crossing
threatened to be very rough. Next morning I reserved
our sleepers and arranged with Spence-Atkins to postpone
his own holiday and to take charge of our paper
till my return; in the evening she warned me, rather
fretfully, that she might not feel well enough to come. I
asked if she would care for me to send for Gaisford;
but, after a night’s rest, she assured me buoyantly that
she was all right. I telegraphed to warn my agent of
our coming; and, when I read out his reply, Barbara exclaimed
with almost hysterical passion that, well or ill,
in fine weather or foul, nothing would induce her to come
with me to Ireland.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, do you mind my leaving you alone here?,” I
asked, when I had recovered my breath.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No. Bobbie Pentyre has arranged his Croxton party
for Whitsuntide.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But why didn’t you tell me that before? I could
have gone another week. Now I’ve made Spence-Atkins
cancel his own plans .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, you’d better stick to your present arrangement,”
she answered. Then, for some reason that I could not
guess, she broke into wild weeping. “I’m so miserable!
I’m mad! I don’t know what I’m saying! George, I’m
sorry I was rude.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You weren’t rude,” I assured her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve not slept for nights and nights,” she gasped.
“You’ve been very patient with me. Go on being patient,
go on loving me! I’m so miserable.” .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This time I determined to be a moral coward no longer:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But why?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I’ve told you! Because I’m a damned soul. I
told you that when you asked me to marry you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And I told you that I’d make you happy or die in
the attempt. There’s nothing I won’t do .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>In her first convulsion of grief, Barbara had allowed
me to take her into my arms; but, as she became more
composed, I felt her struggling gently to be free.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You really mean that?,” she asked, with her head
averted. “If it meant your honour, your life, your happiness,
you’d give all that to see me happy?” I fancied
again that she was challenging me and that, if I made
unguarded reservations, I should be told that I did not
love her as Jack Waring and Eric Lane had loved her.
The second, as she believed, was paying with his life;
the first had already paid with his soul. “I don’t know
what I’m saying!” she cried, with her hands pressed to
her temples. “I’m worried .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. No, I won’t see a
doctor. You go off as you arranged. I’ll go to Croxton
if I feel in the mood. When you come back, I may be
all right; if not .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She stared distractedly round the room in a way that
reminded me of the sad, mad time when Eric first went
out of her life.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But you <span class='it'>will</span> be all right,” I assured her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If I’m not, remember you married a lost soul, George;
I warned you. I kill whatever I touch.” .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<h3>4</h3>

<p class='pindent'>It is hardly to be imagined that I carried a light heart
to Ireland. And the state of the country at this time
was not of a kind to cure any private depression. In
1916 I entered Dublin as an academic nationalist, who
had voted year after year with the staunch, self-effacing
Redmondites; I left as a perfervid Sinn Feiner, when the
men who had played with me as boys five-and-twenty
years before were shot off their crazy barricades or done
to death by a mockery of legal forms. Then for the
first time, face to face with a people cheated of its
promised independence, I too said that no trust was to
be reposed in English honour and no sane leadership
expected from men who believed in English pledges.
Through weary years we liberals had fought constitutionally
for our Home Rule Bill; it was inscribed on the
Statute Book in spite of intrigues and intimidation; but
treason triumphed over constitutionalism on the day when
Germany made war in the belief that an Irish guerilla
would keep Great Britain from taking part.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Melancholy memories and uneasy forebodings were
my companions on the familiar road to Holyhead. I was
dining with my uncle Bertrand on the night when the
Home Rule Act was suspended; he at least had protested
and perhaps he was a little self-righteous, but in 1916
I was to remember his grim prediction that from the
breach of that undertaking, which every party in parliament
helped to repudiate, would follow inevitably the
discredit of the simpleton nationalists and the rise of Sinn
Fein. The rebellion, which he foretold so accurately,
was succeeded by a repression, which he and every one
else knew would continue until the next rebellion. Sinn
Fein, in these first months of the armistice, was penetrating
the country peacefully; but even John Carstairs, who
usually advocated the use of machine-guns and aeroplanes
against political opponents, recognized that there
would be war if the present army of occupation interfered.
As yet there were only sporadic outrages on both sides,
followed by reprisals, followed by counter-reprisals. As
always happens, the non-combatants, squeezed by both
sides, suffered most.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On this score, when at last I reached Lake House, I
had no personal complaint to make. My agent told me
that certain Sinn Feiners had been billeted on me and
certain stores of food commandeered; my gun-room had
been emptied; but both my cars, after a short period of
detention, were returned with a permit from republican
headquarters. This, I believe, made them liable to seizure
by the forces of the crown; but my agent warned me
that any license which recognized the authority of Dublin
Castle would cause the cars to be taken and not restored.
And nothing in Kerry tempted the Castle to send its
emissaries so far into hostile territory. If I abstained
from provocative acts or speeches, I should be left in
peace.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They like you,” my agent was good enough to tell
me; “and it’s what they’re all saying, that you should be
living here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Are the tenants paying me any rent?,” I asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They are.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I drifted away by myself to see how well the house
would suit Barbara. The lake was like a sheet of glass,
in a frame of dense green wood, hanging from the gardens
by the red ribands of the fuchsia hedges. Here and
there I saw thin spirals of smoke: it was turf smoke,
though I could not smell it. From Castlemaine, in the
west, the air blew soft and salt from the Atlantic. I
cursed the malevolence of man that disturbed such peace
and desecrated such beauty. I cursed, too, the fate that
had sent me to an English school, because there was none
good enough in Ireland, so robbing me of one home
without giving me another.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m a married man,” I told my agent, “since last I
was here. I don’t care to bring my wife over till things
are more settled.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>That, he assured me regretfully, was what every one
said; but I should be comfortable enough if I did not
make trouble. He was himself an avowed republican,
not from any hostility to the king, whom he admired, nor
from devotion to the forms and spirit of republicanism:
he wanted peace; and, whether Sinn Fein would achieve
it or not, no other party had succeeded. Sinn Fein was
feared, if not respected; and the English only remembered
Ireland when they were frightened. If Redmond
and his lot had put the fear of God into the English one
half as well as the others, they would be lords and ministers
and the rest now, like Mr. Law and the man who
prosecuted Roger Casement. My agent disapproved of
Sir Edward Carson’s politics but admired him as the
Irishman who had put more fear of God into the English
than any one since Parnell.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The one sentimental relaxation that this hard-headed,
soft-spoken man allowed himself was that Parnell was
still alive and would come back to lead Ireland.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If I could find a purchaser .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.” I began.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“An Englishman? The house would be burnt over
your honour’s head if the whisper of it ran round!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then,” I said, “I may as well be getting back to
London.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>My agent protested with touching fervour, but I was
uneasy at being separated from Barbara. Two days after
I landed at Kingston, she telegraphed: “<span class='it'>Missing you
dreadfully hope you arrived safely and are coming back
immediately all my love bless you</span>”; and, if her language
seemed still a trifle neurotic, she had almost recovered
her tranquillity by the time she wrote to describe the
Whitsuntide party at Croxton Hall. The week-end had
been uneventful; and, though Eric Lane was in the house,
I could not read any embarrassment between the lines
that described their meeting. The nervous excitability,
however, of which I had seen too much evidence in London,
betrayed itself once in a comment on a rumour:
“<span class='it'>You remember the Miss Maitland you met with the
O’Ranes? She’s here. A pretty little thing! Obviously
in love with Eric. I’d give anything to see him happily
married, but I hope he’s not serious about this child.
She’s too hopelessly young, she’d send him mad in a
week. It’ll be too tragic if he lets another woman make
a mess of his life.</span>” The next day Barbara telegraphed
again, telling me once more how much I was being missed
and offering to join me at Lake House.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I returned to London as soon as I had finished my
business and was met at Euston by a shivering form in a
scarlet tea-gown and an ermine cloak.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You crazy child, you’ll give yourself pneumonia!,”
I cried as I hurried her into the car through a double line
of smiling porters.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s a pretty way to greet me when I’ve stayed up
all night for you!,” Barbara laughed. “I <span class='it'>am</span> glad to
see you again, George, though that wasn’t why I came to
meet you. It’s your little friend Ivy Maitland: she’s gone
down suddenly with appendicitis.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, I’m very sorry, of course .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.” I began.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, dear, but we must do something about it. You
know she was acting as Eric’s secretary while his own
girl had a holiday? Yes! And this child has collapsed
in his flat. Dr. Gaisford’s attending her; and he says
she’s not to be moved on any consideration whatsoever.
When I heard about it last night, I felt we <span class='it'>must</span> offer
Eric a couple of rooms till she can return home. Things
being as they are, though .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.” Barbara faltered and
turned away. “It’s all such a muddle that I thought I
couldn’t ask him without your permission.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>From her consulting me, I surmised that she doubted
the wisdom of her impulse. From my knowledge of Eric,
I imagined he would sleep on the Embankment before he
accepted a bed from us. If Barbara wished to make a
sign of friendship, however, I would not check her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You don’t need my permission,” I said. “If you
think it will do any good for us to invite him .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<h3>5</h3>

<p class='pindent'>We received our answer before the invitation could be
sent. At the end of breakfast, Lady John Carstairs telephoned
to say that she had herself placed her house at
Eric’s disposal, but that he preferred to remain in Ryder
Street till the girl was out of danger. On my way to
Fetter Lane, I left some flowers and a card bidding Eric
to let us know if we could be of any service; but we
heard nothing till a week later, when O’Rane telephoned
to catch me for five minutes before I went to bed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I couldn’t get round before,” he apologized, “and I
thought you ought to know. Poor old Eric! He’s getting
all his troubles in a lump. Where’s Babs? I’m
afraid she ought to hear this, too.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I was under the impression that she had gone to bed
half an hour before; but I heard sounds in the drawing-room,
almost as though she had expected news of Eric
and was staying up because it was bad news.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What’s happened to him now?,” I asked, as we went
upstairs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He’s been ordered abroad immediately,” O’Rane answered.
“California. Lungs.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I do not know whether Barbara heard more than the
last word; but she seemed to rise from her chair and
cross the room in a single movement. O’Rane’s expression
changed to wonder and then softened to pity as she
caught and gripped his hand. No name had been mentioned
in her hearing; but I think we both realized that
he and I and all the world—with one exception—might
be ordered to California for our lungs without striking
an equal terror into her heart. In that moment I knew
how far I had always been from winning her love.</p>

<p class='pindent'>O’Rane, I feel, atoned for want of sight by keenness
of hearing. I fancied that a little of the pity in his expression
might be intended for me.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is he .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. dying?,” Barbara whispered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not yet awhile.” O’Rane withdrew his hand to feel
for a chair. I thought I saw his expression changing
again, this time hardening slightly as though to keep the
flash-point of her emotions low or, perhaps, to douse
them with a single chilling jet. “He can get all right
if he wants to. You may imagine, he’s rather bowled
over at present.” As he turned to me, I felt that he
wanted Barbara to hear his next announcement without
being watched. “It came quite suddenly,” he told me;
“and, but for this, you’d have seen him happily married
to Ivy Maitland.” If Barbara gave any sign of interest,
I saw and heard nothing. O’Rane took time to let his
announcement sink in; and I fancied again that he was
tacitly advising her to close her side of an account which
Eric had already closed against her. If she chose to
think that he was still in love with her and that his
engagement to Ivy was an act of despair, no argument
would cure her; at least there was now no reason why
this shadow should force its way between us any longer.
“It’s rather a facer,” O’Rane continued, “when you lose
your wife and your health on the same day. I’ve been
telling him all evening that no woman in the world is
big enough to spoil a man’s life, but at the moment he’s
in the mood to creep into a corner and die. He’s too
good for that. I want you to see him before he starts,
George; and write to him while he’s away.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Naturally, I promised without hesitation. If Barbara
sent a letter of farewell, she said nothing to me about
it; when I told her next day that I was going to Ryder
Street on my way to the office, she nodded abstractedly
but made no suggestion of accompanying me; and, on my
return, she sat like a spirit of tragedy, refusing to ask
me the result of my mission, till I volunteered to tell her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“By the way, I missed Eric this morning,” I said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh? Had he gone already?,” she asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The maid said he was not at home,” I answered; and,
mercifully for me, Barbara did not enquire further.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A less diplomatic version would have recounted that, as
I hurried round to Ryder Street, I saw Eric getting out
of the taxi in front of me. His front-door slammed as
I was halfway up the stairs; and, when I said something
to the maid about being one of his older friends, I was
informed that Miss Maitland was still seriously ill. Divining
that Miss Maitland could not be occupying all the
rooms in the flat, I scribbled a note in which I begged
Eric to see me for two minutes. A verbal message
apprised me that Mr. Lane was engaged; and I went away,
more hurt, I believe, than ever in my life before. Since
his interrupted romance with Ivy, the fellow could bear
me no grudge for marrying the woman he had tried so
long to win; our friendship went back, sixteen years, to
Oxford and the dinners of the Phœnix. There were not
too many survivors from those days; and, coming to
sympathize, I had seen my sympathy flung back in my
face. I made every allowance for his illness and misery;
but I could not write to him, at least for the present and,
when a letter from him, several months later, hurtled
like a flask of vitriol from California to England, I was
too nearly blinded to attempt an answer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Will you call again?,” asked Barbara perfunctorily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t suppose he wants to be bothered,” I said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was a long silence; and Barbara’s shoulders
moved in a slight shrug:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t suppose he wants to be friends. I tried, when
we met at Croxton; but, when there’s been love, I don’t
think you can go back to friendship.” She looked at me
almost guiltily; and for an embarrassed moment I feared
that I was to be drawn into yet one more unwanted confidence.
Then, changing her mind, she walked slowly
to the fire and stood with the dancing flames reflected in
her sombre eyes. “I’m .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. <span class='it'>glad</span> he’s going,” she murmured
at last. “I’ve not really been myself since I met
him again, whatever I told you about feeling free. When
you wanted me to come with you to Ireland .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I was
mad. I’ll go with you now, if you like .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. anywhere.
We’ve talked so often about a fresh start: I can make it
now. I <span class='it'>do</span> want our life to be a success. If there’s anything
I can do .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You can’t do more than you’re doing at present,” I
said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>With a sudden turn, Barbara flung her arms about my
neck and hid her face against my chest.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is there nothing more that you want?,” she asked.
“Don’t say ‘your happiness’! I know you want that,
darling. Don’t you want anything for yourself? Don’t
you want me to be like other women? Don’t you want
me to have children?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Most men want children,” I said, “but women have
to bear them.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I’ve always wanted children and I’ve always
been afraid of them. I’m still afraid, .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. but I’m
going to have one now, George, .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. for your sake.
You’re pleased? Hold me tight, darling, and promise
me one thing. If anything goes wrong .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But, good God .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.!,” I began.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It <span class='it'>may</span>. If anything <span class='it'>does</span> go wrong and one of us
has to die, promise you’ll let it be me!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I was dispensed from answering by Barbara’s sudden
surrender to hysterics. When she was recovered, I put
her to bed and sent for Gaisford; as soon as he allowed
her up, I took her to Crawleigh Abbey and left her to
recuperate from something which the doctor described
enigmatically as “a nervous breakdown that didn’t come
off”.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve been expecting this for years,” he told me.
“And for years I’ve felt that she’d be a healthier, happier
woman when she had some brats to look after. This
business about Eric Lane must have been a shock to her.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, thank Heaven, that’s all over,” I said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“At last,” Gaisford grunted. “If you’re going down
to Crawleigh .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I shall stay here, except for week-ends, unless I’m
sent for,” I interrupted. “This is going to be a busy
time. The peace terms are to be signed within the next
few days.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wonder what kind of mess they’ve been making out
there,” Gaisford mused.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re convinced it <span class='it'>will</span> be a mess?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My dear George, when two human beings get together,
they always make a big mess,” he answered with
more than his usual misanthropy; “and I’ve known human
beings who could make a fair-sized mess with their
four unaided paws.”</p>

<h3>6</h3>

<p class='pindent'>The peace of Versailles was celebrated in London with
thanksgivings by day and fireworks at night.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wonder why,” said Bertrand sadly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Lady Dainton wants me to bring you to her party at
the Excelsior,” I said, though, when he repeated: “I
wonder why”, it was not easy to find a convincing answer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Are <span class='it'>you</span> going?” he asked suspiciously, as though I
were revenging myself on him for my dinners in Rutland
Gate.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” I answered. “I wonder why myself; but I’m
a bachelor at present and I must dine somewhere.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All right,” sighed my uncle; and, on that, we drove
to the office and sat until seven o’clock considering the
terms and discussing, with Spence-Atkins and any one
else who drifted in, what the future policy of our paper
was to be.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For several weeks the dearth of news in Fetter Lane
and the claims of outside interests had brought our
fragile bantling to the verge of death by starvation. Ministers,
I thought, revealed a shrewd knowledge of mass-psychology
in denying us all news of the conference.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Kid asks for a thing,” explained Sir Philip Saltash,
when I loosed a grumble in his hearing; “you refuse it;
kid screams. Go on refusing it; kid goes on screaming.
Go on refusing still; kid thinks of something else.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>By July, even the press had almost ceased to scream;
parliament had long been silent; and the country was
probably thinking of a prize-fight. My own record was
representative of the vast majority: I went to my office
six days a week, I continued the farce of exploring London
to find what people were thinking, I supported a wall
at the parties which my wife gave to please my uncle;
but such intellectual energy as I possessed had been devoted
at one moment to my private affairs in Ireland, at
another to O’Rane’s inheritance and again at another to
the havoc which poor Eric Lane’s return had wrought in
my life with Barbara. At our editorial dinners I was
chiefly concerned to see that we had enough readable
matter of any kind to fill twenty-four pages. Like the
child in Saltash’s parable, I was now indifferent; and,
when at last the great secrets which we had screamed to
know were flung to us in bulk, we were mildly bored.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I warned you at Cannes how it would be,” said Bertrand;
then he lapsed into unhelpful silence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You heard what they were saying in Paris?,” asked
Spence-Atkins. “ ‘The seeds of a great and durable
war’.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Meanwhile,” I said, “as our first article will be on
the treaty .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>We had reached no decision by the time my uncle and
I adjourned for dinner with the Daintons; if seventy men
out of London’s seven millions understood what kind of
peace had been made, I do not believe that seven men of
the seventy cared by now whether it was a good peace or
a bad.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Indifference! Indifference!,” Bertrand sighed. “If
you compare this night with the day of the armistice .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
We said ‘never again!’; and we meant it. Now, though
half the world’s still in mourning, we’re racing along a
road that will put the other half in mourning.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I suppose you can never repeat your emotions,” I
ventured, as I followed his gaze over the packed restaurant.
“The war ended at the armistice; people say
‘All right! It’s <span class='it'>still</span> ended.’ ”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And they’re not interested to see whether the present
world is built on quicksand.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No one can say <span class='it'>we</span> haven’t done our best to warn
people,” I said wearily, as the Daintons came into the
lounge.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No one but a fool would say that any one had paid
the slightest attention to our warnings,” Bertrand rejoined.
“The harm’s done now. That phase is over.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>As we went in to dinner, Lady Dainton told me that
the scene was quite like 1914. From a long and intimate
acquaintance with her no less than from the ring of pleasure
in her voice, I realized that this was her return from
exile: for thirty years she had lived and laboured to enter
what she considered the “right” houses and to secure the
“right” people in her own. The war had thrown her
out of work; but she could begin again now. One of her
sons had been killed, the other wounded; her daughter
had disappointed the family by marrying O’Rane and
shocked it by running away from him; for the Daintons,
who had worked as hard as any one, it had not been a
pleasant or an easy war; and now Lady Dainton was
dismissing it as a regrettable incident, least said, soonest
mended. She was not wanting in affection for her dead
son nor for the son who would be among the first to die
if another war came; but she was by now too inelastic
to remodel her daily life, still less to attempt improvements
on the scene of 1914 when there were no
‘profiteers’, no ‘temporary gentlemen’, no six-shilling
income-tax, no bloated wages for insatiable domestic
servants.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You think it will last?,” I enquired.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I feel sure it will,” she answered. “It’s to <span class='it'>all</span> our
interests, don’t you know?, to keep the big houses open,
to have plenty of employment, money circulating.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
Of course, if the socialists had their way .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. but I don’t
think there’s much socialism in England, George. The
war has thrown people together so much. The agitators
simply wouldn’t be able to make a living if they weren’t
paid from abroad. There’s a little book I must send you
on the Jewish peril.” .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A new taste for spreading scares was the only change
that I could detect in my hostess. Whereas she had occupied
herself before the war by sitting on endless committees,
she reached a larger public now by sitting at home
and inundating her friends with pamphlets on bolshevism,
prohibition, the white-slave traffic, secular education and
every other danger that threatened, day by day, to sap
the security of England. Sir Roger, I fancy, had changed
even less. Whereas he had formerly jobbed in and out
of wild-cat industrial securities, he now dabbled in the
more chaotic of the European exchanges. Sonia danced;
Sam had left his firm of contractors in Hartlepool for a
vague “agency-business” of his own in London; Tom
Dainton’s widow had married again; and I believe this
single family could have been reproduced, in every detail
of history and circumstance, in almost every town and
county throughout Great Britain and Ireland.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“George not being pessimistic, is he?,” Sir Roger enquired
genially, as we settled into our places.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I confess I don’t like the outlook,” I said; and for
the life of me I could not imagine how any one enjoyed
the prospect of a peace abroad that was nothing but a
silent war. My volatile host had been sufficiently dissatisfied
a few days before when the labour party, realizing
that the government was properly contemptuous of
its servile supporters in the House of Commons, threatened
the “direct action” of a general strike. Dainton
knew; and I knew; and every man with a smattering of
economic history knew that the present boom would be
followed by a disastrous slump. “Things seem too good
to last.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The flow of geniality ran suddenly dry.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’d be the first to complain if they did,” said
Dainton; and his tone surprised me out of a reply till I
noticed his flushed face and watery eyes. “My friend
George has great qualities,” he continued, with malicious
jocularity, to the table at large, “but he’s no great shakes
as a prophet. Before the war he told us there would be
no war; when it came, he said it could never end one way
or the other; now that it’s ended, he says it <span class='it'>must</span> start
again. Cheerful customer, George.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I might have reminded him that in the nineties he was
prophesying an inevitable war with Russia, in the nineteen-hundreds
with France. I might have asked him to
reconcile the treaty of Versailles with the fourteen
points. I might have enquired whether he would keep his
promises of the December election that the kaiser should
be hanged and the whole cost of the war covered by a
German indemnity. In the interests of a quiet dinner, I
said nothing; Dainton, as a political barometer, was more
valuable to me than Dainton as a political controversialist.
I realized for the first time that the class which he represented
would be our most aggressive antagonists when we
worked to secure a sane peace. Thanks to the determination
of the French prime minister and the vacillation of
our own, he was enabled to go back impenitently to the
mood of his election address. No longer speaking of
“Wilson, <span class='it'>le bienvenu</span>”, he had discovered in the president
an insidious agent for strengthening Germany and
weakening France. Forgetting his earlier lip-service to
the League of Nations, he paraded comparative populations
and, in my hearing that night, based his hopes of
enduring peace on “bleeding Germany white and keeping
her white”.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I had not, for several months, mentioned the inflammatory
fourteen points: had I done so, Dainton might have
retorted that President Wilson had himself departed from
them by throwing his lot in with M. Clemenceau and Mr.
Lloyd-George. I did not discuss the equity of the peace
terms. I discussed very little with Dainton; but I tried,
as I had been trying all day, to envisage the new world
which circumstances and the efforts of the peace conference
were labouring to bear. Russia was in the grip of
revolution, civil war and famine; Germany, Austria, Hungary
and Italy might follow at any moment; the map of
Europe was dotted with strangely named, new, self-governing
republics, alike only in their complete ignorance
of self-government; as we were soon to see, there was no
European police to restrain the Italian who might be inspired
to seize Fiume or the Rumanian who was tempted
to march on Buda Pesht; the League of Nations had been
invested with no power; and the world outside Europe,
from India to Egypt and from Ireland to the Philippines,
had been taught the magic word “self-determination”
and had realized its possibilities more vividly than those
who coined it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In an unguarded moment I did ask Dainton whether
he imagined that the Germans could ever pay the indemnity
which he had so sternly demanded. He believed it
confidently. How, I asked him; but Dainton told me that
he was not in the mood to split hairs: if they could pay
it, they should (and the allies would remain in occupation
till the last penny had been handed over); if the Hun
ruined himself in the attempt, as I seemed to think likely,
it would be something to feel that he would never again
menace the world.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And if he ruins us too?,” I asked. “Economically,
the whole world is knitted together. If the Russian revolution
spreads to Germany?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It won’t spread here,” Dainton answered in happy
forgetfulness of earlier speeches against the corrupting
influence of those Russian and German agents who controlled
British trades unions. “Our people are too sensible.
You’re very gloomy, George! This won’t do at
all. Drink up that cocktail and let’s begin our dinner.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>As I looked round on the scene of peace, now officially
proclaimed, I reflected that five years, all but a few days,
had passed since I strolled on to the valley-terrace at
Chepstow, to smoke a cigarette between dances; it seemed
less than five weeks since Colonel Farwell walked diffidently
out of the darkness to say that, while war had not
yet been declared, it was prudent for all officers to be in
touch with their depots. They had gone, those first, in
a spirit of routine enlivened by adventure; they were
followed by men who went in a spirit of bewilderment
clarified by sacrifice. The bewilderment passed; and the
sacrifice turned to resignation. Soon the resignation became
fatalism: every one went because every one else was
going; none expected to come back, and, of those who
went first, few were cheated of their expectation. Now
we were celebrating the end of a war that dwarfed the
campaigns of Napoleon to so many intermittent brawls.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I must have spoken the name, for my uncle caught at
it eagerly:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Seventeen-ninety-three, eighteen-fifteen,” he murmured.
“Nineteen-fourteen, nineteen-nineteen. Napoleon
ended the middle ages and changed the map. Have
we begun anything, ended anything, changed anything?
We spilt a paint-box over the atlas; but will the colours
stick? Germany and Russia cancel out; the rest of us
have to play for pennies instead of shillings; but have we
ended war, have we ended the nineteenth century, have
we done anything but lose a few pawns in the first
moves?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’d won <span class='it'>everything</span> at the armistice!,” I exclaimed.
“The world was ready and willing to be disarmed, ready
and willing to accept arbitration in place of war .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What election-cry has a chance against ‘revenge’?,”
Bertrand demanded, with a glance of contempt towards
the end of the table, when Dainton was arguing heatedly
with the wine-waiter. “ ‘The red account is cast’; and
Germany must pay. You and I know that we shall be the
first to suffer. You and I know that these dolts are laying
the foundations of the next war. You and I know
that we have some misty world-vision and that we must
work for a united states of Europe and a brotherhood of
man. People won’t listen to us .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. yet. I shall be dead
before you’ve cleared the first unbelievers out of the temple.
<span class='it'>Si monumentum requiris</span> .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. George, George,
this is a blacker day in the world’s history than the
fourth of August.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I have forgotten almost everything about that dinner
except the sense of depression that grew deeper with
every advance to gaiety on the part of my neighbours.
We were spared speeches; but at the end our host called
us to our feet for some toast which I did not hear. As
I sat down, a kite’s-tail of coloured paper floated to us
from the next table. A giant bunch of air-balloons was
divided among eager hands. Crackers exploded; and a
blare of tin trumpets punctuated the cheeping of wooden
whistles. Perhaps I had spent too many hours that day
in discussion that led nowhere: I suddenly felt that I was
not in the mood for such artless merry-making.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Si monumentum requiris</span> .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.” Bertrand repeated.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At the table from which that tail of coloured paper had
been thrown, I observed my old ally, Sir Philip Saltash,
entertaining a party of friends. Dainton, in acknowledging
a bow, informed us that Saltash had “done as much
as any one to win the war”; and, in examining Saltash’s
guests, I felt that the same tribute could be paid to each.
Wilmot Dean, representing a government of new men
and new methods, was resting a flushed face on the bare
shoulder of a beautiful and, I should imagine, wholly
brainless mannequin. Lord Lingfield, whose inclusion in
the cabinet shewed that ministers were not indifferent to
rank and lineage, was deep in conversation with a Balkan
millionaire who had been naturalized in time to become
private secretary to the needy holder of a sinecure. And
any one with attention to spare had it unpityingly claimed
by Mr. ‘Blob’ Wister, who had won the war by purchasing
papers for the government.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I did not know the rest. I did not greatly want to
know them. If I had been asked who won the war, I
should have named David O’Rane rather than Wilmot
Dean, Lord Loring rather than Lord Lingfield. Saltash’s
guests may have given body and soul to victory; but their
material position was founded on the war. After fine
winnowing, we had arrived—in these ‘new men’—at
the governing class of the immediate future: borrowing
the name from ‘Blob’ Wister, they called themselves
“realists”, and the coalitions of 1915 and 1916 had certainly
intrigued the “sentimentalist” in politics to his
extinction. Peace was too welcome for me to complain
if it had been ushered in by ministers with more ambition
than scruple. An obsolescent administration may have
needed business brains to fit it for war; a democratic
country cannot ignore its press-man and publicity-agent;
and the rich hangers-on of a government only prove that
bricks cannot be made without straw. Of the men who
had won the war I only felt what Bertrand expressed
bluntly:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They look as if they’d made a damned good thing
out of it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Seventeen-ninety-three, eighteen-fifteen,” I replied.
“Nineteen-fourteen to nineteen-nineteen. We have
changed our rulers.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s about all we <span class='it'>have</span> changed,” Bertrand rejoined.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then we stood up as a waiter begged leave to push our
table away from the dancing-floor. Sir Roger, unexpectedly
on his feet, exhibited symptoms of impending
oratory, which was checked, at the instigation of Wilmot
Dean, by a well-directed crust of bread from the hand of
the mannequin. The band, for the first time in several
years, played the national anthems of all the allies. Our
host ordered more champagne and then called for his bill.
Sonia led off the dancing with Lord Lingfield; and I
invented an excuse to go home to bed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The streets round the hotel were too crowded for
driving. I told my chauffeur to get home as best he could
and walked with Bertrand into the quiet backwaters north
of Piccadilly. At the door of Loring House we met my
cousin Violet, who insisted on our going the rest of the
way in her car.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve missed all the celebrations,” she told us. “I’ve
been unveiling the memorial to Jim at Chepstow.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’ve not missed very much,” I answered. “Are
you satisfied with the memorial?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes. It’s only a medallion in the chapel; and you
can only see it from the corner where I sit. I have .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
rather a horror of the war-memorials that are being put
up everywhere.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They’re the easiest means of forgetting the dead with
a good conscience,” Bertrand suggested.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But not the only means,” I said, as a dishevelled
vagrant steadied himself against the bonnet of the car
and invited us to a confession of political faith.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Its form consisted of question and answer: “<span class='it'>What’s
the matter with Lloyd-George? ’E’s orl right! And
what’s the matter with Winston? ’E’s orl right. What’s
the matter with Beatty?</span>” .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That fellow is surprisingly like our friend Dainton,”
said my uncle.</p>

<h3>1</h3>

<p class='pindent'>On the day after the peace-treaty had been signed, my
uncle sent me to make a political survey of England.
If it brought no benefit to England or to our paper, it
provided me with a pleasant holiday and a welcome
break.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Looking back on my two years’ labours in Fetter Lane,
I feel that the first six months were given to creating an
atmosphere. As Bertrand proclaimed at our inaugural
dinner, no lasting peace could be established on a sense
of grievance; and, until the terms of peace were published,
we tried to deflect public attention from crude
thoughts of triumph and cruder hankerings after revenge
to a frank desire for mutual forgiveness and good-will.
For twelve months after the treaty was placed in our
hands, we laboured to demonstrate that it was unworkable.
And in the six months during which the peace
coalition was tottering to the fall I received my answer
to the old question whether those who could neither keep
peace nor make war were competent to make peace.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It won’t do,” Bertrand declared summarily, when we
met to discuss our public attitude to the treaty of Versailles.
“ ‘Revision’ must be our battle-cry. Revision
of the treaty.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I fancy I was expressing what Spence-Atkins and Triskett
and all of us had long felt, when I said:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thank God we have a battle-cry at last.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It will not be popular,” predicted my uncle, with his
usual love for being in a minority. “The fools who
shouted that we were ‘letting the Hun off’ will shout
more than ever that we’re making the treaty ‘a scrap
of paper’.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. And yet, if we try to enforce it, all
central Europe will go the way of Russia.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m afraid it will be another unpopular cry,” added
Jefferson Wright, “but it’s time we drew attention to the
economic position at home. We’re pouring out money
as though the war were still going on.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Our battle-cry, then,” said Bertrand, “must be ‘Produce
more and consume less’.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We shall be told we’re trying to enslave labour. And
there’ll be no end to unemployment when the ‘consuming
less’ begins.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’re here to tell people the truth, even if it’s an
unpleasant truth,” Bertrand rejoined with stern virtue;
and our shorthand-writer looked up encouragingly to see
if this also was to be a battle-cry.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then, as Wright and Spence-Atkins had been given
their orders, he packed me out of the office to collect
material for six articles on <span class='it'>England in Reconstruction</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The great pulse of the people,” he ordained as my
objective. “London’s a hot-house: abnormal.”</p>

<h3>2</h3>

<p class='pindent'>My last duty, before taking the road, was to attend
little Ivy Maitland’s wedding.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She had wasted no time, I thought, in consoling herself
for the loss of Eric Lane; but the quick decisions and
quicker changes of this period were a conspicuous part of
the “abnormality” which my uncle found devastating
London in the first years of peace. We attended the ceremony,
on O’Rane’s entreaty, to support Ivy, who was out
of favour with most of her friends; and we went on to
the reception in the hope of comforting Mr. Justice Maitland,
who was deriving a morose satisfaction from
prophesying the inevitable misery which his daughter was
laying up for herself. I seem to possess an irresistible
fascination for elderly bores; and the first chapter in my
survey of England might have been headed: <span class='it'>Maitland
on the Decay of Faith and Morals</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It would break your heart,” he told me, “if you
listened to some of the stories I have to hear in the
Divorce Court. If young people thought less of themselves
and more of their elders .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. The churches have
lost their grip. Young people don’t take us into their
confidence.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Did they ever,” I asked, “where marriage was concerned?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The judge pursued his denunciation without a check:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Headstrong children like Ivy rush into it quite cynically.
Their deepest affections are not engaged, so they
have little to fear from failure; as for the scandal, none
of their friends think the worse of them.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s a reaction from the cramping discipline of the
war,” I answered. “The people who find their way into
the Divorce Court are taking their revenge, in private
lawlessness, for long submission to a machine that had
neither body to be kicked nor soul to be damned.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>If my explanation was heard, it was not answered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“One woman, my dear Oakleigh,” the judge recalled
sombrely and unseasonably as his daughter drove away
for her honeymoon, “actually asked me—in court—what
was to be done with a husband who insulted her in
public: it was not, she explained, as if they had not a
home where he could do that. It’s terrible!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I agreed; but, as I could suggest no remedy, I took my
leave and motored Barbara to Chepstow for a week before
we set our hand on the great pulse of the people in
Scotland. Most of the houses where we stayed had been
closed for five years or turned into hospitals; and, as
they opened their doors, I felt that the interrupted play
of 1914 was being resumed on a stage from which all
the old actors had departed. The new avenue at Loring
Castle seemed no taller; if the dogs were older, they were
for the most part the same dogs; but the present marquess
was a four-year-old boy whose father was reported
missing some eight-and-forty hours before he himself
came into the world. The terrible emptiness of those days
returned to me when I saw Violet walking by herself
along the valley-terrace, where I had walked with her husband
on the last night of peace.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I wondered how much of Jim Loring’s world would
survive into this child’s manhood. The servant who unpacked
for me confided that he was marking time till he
heard of an opening in the colonies. The house-carpenter,
who had married one of the maids, told me that
he was setting up in business with her savings from a
munition-works. The stud-groom engaged me unexpectedly
in a discussion of the Pyramids, which he had
visited since last I stayed at Chepstow. At first I thought
that in his blood, too, unrest was stirring; but I discovered
later that the war had only changed his outlook by
convincing him of the literal truth of the Old Testament.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Moses .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and them Pharaohs,” he murmured to
himself, looking dreamily towards the junction of Wye
and Severn as though it were the Red Sea waiting to
pile up its waters and let the children of Israel through.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He at least had no desire to roam. Grandfather, father
and son, the family had lived and died in sight of the
Castle stables; and he would have repudiated his king
before he defaulted in his allegiance to the Lorings. In
Gallipoli, I gathered, there were frothy, worthless fellows—the
scum of midland factories and the dregs of South
Welsh pits—who were ready enough to criticize their
betters. Firebrands and hot-heads, they maintained that
their betters had muddled them into the war and that, if
the politicians and the generals had known their job as
well as the hewers and fitters, the flower of an army
would not have been sent to its death in this way. Their
“betters”, according to these critics, had been found out.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I suggested that the French, in spite of their scientific
training, and the Americans, for all their democratic upbringing
had also made blunders; so, I added, had the
Germans; but I was preaching to the converted. This
criticism was the yapping of town-bred curs; and, if anything
exceeded my friend’s devotion to his feudal head,
it was his scorn and hatred for the thieving upstarts of
city streets.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then you don’t think anything will come of all this
talk?,” I asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not while their lazy bellies are full, sir,” he answered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>How long that would be was one of the problems that
Bertrand had sent me to solve.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So long as the price of wheat stops where it is,” one
of Violet’s tenant-farmers told me, “I can make a living.
Of course, if her ladyship raises my rent .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.” He
complained of the wages that had to be paid nowadays
to old men and boys for a third of the work that was
done before the war. “I can’t reduce them,” he added.
“Why, d’you know, sir, what a pair of good boots costs
you in Chepstow to-day?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I have forgotten the figure; but, when I had occasion
to make a few purchases, the shop-keepers apologized for
their charges. The cost of labour and materials had gone
up; but you could not reduce them when living was so
expensive.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A loaf of bread nowadays .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.” began the bootmaker
who was oppressing the tenant-farmer’s labourer,
who was keeping up the price of bread.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then he muttered something about “middlemen” and
“profiteers”.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At the other end of the scale, Violet Loring deferred
making any improvements on the Chepstow estate until
her tenants paid a rent commensurate with the high cost
of labour and material. She was a rich woman, by the
standard of gross income; but she had three houses in
England, a palace in Scotland and a derelict barrack in
Ireland. The greater part of her income was derived
from coal; and the latest strike-cloud was being illuminated
terrifyingly with lightning-forks that spelt ‘nationalization’.
In one paper I read that some Angevin king,
with more generosity than geography, had granted to Sir
Humfrey de Loringe certain lands that were his by right
of seizure alone; the paper—and I with it—knew of
no service by Sir Humfrey to the community at large
that justified this grant in perpetuity; and, if right of
seizure was the basis of the Loring estates in one century,
right of seizure—it was suggested—might be the
means of expropriating the Lorings in another.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t think there’ll be any confiscation in my time,”
said Violet, “but I have to think of Sandy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And her surplus income was therefore being invested
in various securities of various foreign countries, in the
hope that all would not default at the same moment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As I moved to houses less well endowed than my
cousin’s, I found the uneasiness more marked. The
Knightriders, taking early advantage of the boom in real
estate, had sold their house in Raglan to a rich colliery-proprietor;
John Carstairs, when we went to stay with
him at Herrig, said that, after this experimental year, he
would have to let the shooting; and our visit to Philip
Hornbeck in Yorkshire had to be cancelled because his
wife had suggested a general reduction of wages and his
servants had left her in a body without notice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Insecurity is the first, universal quality of the times</span>,”
I wrote to my uncle.</p>

<h3>3</h3>

<p class='pindent'>At the beginning of the autumn, a railway-strike assailed
the country with partial paralysis.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>It may help</span>,” wrote Bertrand from the security of
London, “<span class='it'>to bring people to their senses. They think
they’re rich because the printing-presses keep ’em well supplied
with depreciated notes. As usual, Spence-Atkins
prophesies a tremendous slump; and that will be just as
unreal as the boom. If people would think in terms of
commodities and services instead of chattering about
money!</span></p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>But this is not the worst of the trouble. The triple
alliance is a political engine. Direct action is a political
method; the reply of organized labour to a government
that represents no one in particular and organized labour
least of all. This is the first protest against the 1918 election
and I’ve been torn in pieces by the tory press for asking
what else any sane man could have expected, when
the present House never tries to control ministers.</span> ‘Vous
l’avez voulu, Georges Dandin.’ ”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Barbara and I turned south on the first day of the
strike; and, by the time we reached Crawleigh Abbey, it
was over. In the tone of my father-in-law, however, I
detected a new rancour such as I had not met since the
almost daily strikes and lock-outs before the war. Neave
had been warned for duty; and, as he changed out of uniform,
I fancied that father and son were like a pair of
reluctant game-cocks, as difficult to drag out of a fight as
to urge in.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I regret nothing,” said Crawleigh on the first night,
“that shews labour it can’t hold the country to ransom.
If I’d been the prime minister, though, I’d have recalled
every man jack of them to the colours .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And if they refused to come?,” I ventured to interrupt.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“After being ordered to mobilize?,” asked Neave with
the aloof patience of a Guards officer in teaching a civilian
his A.B.C.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” I answered. “In 1914 the regular officer
threatened to resign if he were ordered to put down rebellion
in Ulster. That’s never been quoted, but you may
be sure it’s not been forgotten. And if you ever try to
use troops against an industrial strike .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I should use troops to protect life and property,”
Crawleigh interposed. “A very few days without trains,
and the babies in every city would die for want of milk.
One hopes that these drastic steps will never be necessary.
One hopes the lesson’s been taken to heart.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I hope so too,” I said; but I knew Crawleigh to be
only one of many who regretted that the strike had not
been fought to a finish.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As I began my articles, I noticed sadly that neither he
nor Neave, neither the capitalist press which called our
paper “bolshevistic” nor the labour sheets which damned
us with faint, patronizing praise suggested that strikes
and lock-outs ought to be as impossible in a civilized state
as a wheat-corner or that, whoever was to blame and whoever
was punished, the noncombatant majority suffered
most.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Human nature being what it is .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.” began Sir
Roger Dainton, with a fine affectation of political wisdom,
when I put this view before him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I had driven Barbara to luncheon at Crowley Court;
and throughout the meal our host droned of high taxation
without considering the capital loss of a strike.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Every one’s the poorer for a struggle that has
changed nothing and proved nothing,” I said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In time, perhaps, the agitators will see that,” answered
Lady Dainton, who had been expatiating, from
the other end of the table, on class-hatred and proving in
alternate sentences that the man Thomas was responsible
for all this unrest and that Mr. Thomas really seemed the
only person who would stand up to these bolshevists.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was at this time that the secret funds on which
labour disturbances throve were discovered—by her—to
come from Irish organizations in America and Jewish
societies in Russia; perhaps her brain was tired, but in
the course of one brief conversation the Indian home-ruler,
the modernist in religion, the eccentric in music
and the individualist in dress were all found to be tainted
with “bolshevism”. Their predecessors, I recalled, had
all been anarchists.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I must send you a little book on <span class='it'>The Soviet Peril</span>,”
promised Lady Dainton, who at other times and in her
untiring search for whipping-boys had sent me pamphlets
on <span class='it'>A Short Way with Profiteers</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I refrained from commenting on her husband’s incautious
boast that he had increased his capital twenty <span class='it'>per
cent.</span> since 1914.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Are these agitators actually to be found in England?,”
I asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Lady Dainton assured me that they were, though
neither she nor any one she knew had actually met one.
Not content with fomenting revolution on earth, they
were unseating religion from on high. Communist
schools were springing up to poison youthful minds with
secularist literature. So far as I could make out, she
accounted it for enlightenment when her own friends
paraded their scepticism; but, if there had been no god,
she would have invented one for the poorer classes. It
was no defence that the secular propagandist might be a
sincere secularist; so long as he was paid, he stood condemned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“By the same test,” I asked, “would you call the clergy
of the Established Church or the officers of the Employers’
Defence League ‘paid agitators’?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Certainly not! Good gracious, why .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.?” she
asked in a voice that faded into the silence of stupefaction.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The pulse of the Dainton family was the last that I
felt before returning to London and presenting Bertrand
with my report on the first phase of reconstruction.
Looking over this review later, I noticed a <span class='it'>diminuendo</span>
in the rather robust optimism with which I began. England
was still enjoying superficial plenty; and yet I heard
a mutter of misgiving. Some of the factories were over-producing;
finished articles, of material bought at war prices,
had to be sold at post-war prices; credit became
harder to obtain from the banks; and, as the first year
of peace hastened to its close, other people than the Daintons
woke to the unpleasant discovery that income-tax
would have to be paid as though the war were still being
waged and that they had for a year, in disregard of Bertrand’s
battle-cries, been producing less and consuming
more than they could afford.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was a time to draw in horns. Barbara and I had
ordered a new car; and in a spirit of prudence we decided
to cancel the order. Sam Dainton—I hope, without
his mother’s knowledge—gave me £300 for my place
in the waiting-list and made another £300 within two
days by selling it to one of the Jews against whom I was
so indefatigably warned. After this one experience of
practical finance and of an “agency-business” as conducted
by Sam, I went back to the unassailable heights
of theory; and for the next six months, until other cares
claimed my attention, I watched the unreal boom of 1919
changing to the unreal slump of 1920.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The one was no better justified than the other. While
the country clamoured for houses, the building trade
clamoured for work; domestic servants were not to be
procured, and the figures of unemployment rose steeply.
Every other country, I read, was working overtime; and
our own exports threatened to dry up.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ever heard of a man called Keynes, George?,” my
uncle asked on my return, tossing me <span class='it'>The Economic Consequences
of the Peace</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes. I sent my copy to your friend Dainton. It was
the least I could do after the literature that his good lady
has been pouring in on me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What Keynes preaches from inside knowledge is
what I’ve been preaching to you since the armistice.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s what our worthy Wright and every other economist
would have preached, if he’d had the figures before
him,” I answered. “But have you seen Keynes’ reception
in the press? This country’s still drunk from armistice
night. <span class='it'>People won’t listen.</span>”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And then I told Bertrand of the psychological discovery
that impressed me most in the whole course of my
tour. On the minds of men who had taken part in the
war the printed word had ceased to exert its old spell.
In the first recruiting of 1914 the boys in my old Wiltshire
constituency were forbidden to pluck the blackberries
by the roadside, because a mysterious red car had
been abroad, before daylight, sprinkling the hedges with
what was believed to be a strong solution of typhoid
germs. The story was printed in the papers and believed
because it was in print. Five years later the same story—with
a Russian or a Sinn Feiner in charge of the car—might
have been believed until it was published; then
it would have been relegated to the teeming limbo of
“newspaper lies”. The captain of the Loring yacht, who
had served for most of the war on an auxiliary cruiser,
told me of his amazement on reading that the <span class='it'>Pelion</span>,
which was at that time his home, had been sunk by a
mine in the North Sea; he was less surprised, though
more aggrieved, to read a year later that his ship, which
had lately been sunk by a torpedo in the Irish Channel,
was still convoying troopers in the Mediterranean. He
accepted my explanation that the Admiralty was of malice
aforethought misleading the newspaper-readers of England
in the hope of misleading the German intelligence
department; but his faith was shattered beyond repair.
If the press lied to him on matters which he could check
from his own experience, how much more easily it would
lie about defeats and casualties, wages and prices!</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And in future,” I told Bertrand, “we have to reckon
with this incredulity in addition to all the apathy that’s
been breaking our hearts.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>And</span> the misrepresentation,” he sighed with a sensitiveness
surprising in so scarred a fighter to the charge
of the Woburn press that he was selling the French for
thirty pieces of German silver.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There are times,” I said, “when I feel that only the
logic of events will convince people. Aren’t we wasting
our energy, Bertrand? I’ve given the experiment more
than six months’ trial; now I want to get away. Barbara’s
going to have a baby.” .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I could have piled argument on argument if my uncle
had resisted me; but he sat without speaking, his hands
crossing and uncrossing themselves tremulously over the
ivory knob of his stick and his eyes set gloomily on the
fire.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The logic of events?,” he repeated at length.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t believe we shall do any good here till we have
a revolution,” I said, with bitter memories of my battle-piece
in its three panels. “A revolution; or another war.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Our intention was to avert it,” he reminded me.</p>

<h3>4</h3>

<p class='pindent'>Because Bertrand made no effort to detain me, I stayed
in London—sullenly protesting that we only bored the
converted and exasperated the inconvertible—till the end
of the year. Looking back, I suppose the autumn brought
with it the first signs of returning reason, though Sir
Roger Dainton—more in sorrow than anger—burnt
the <span class='it'>Economic Consequences</span> and left me—with anger
and sorrow nicely balanced—to buy myself another copy.
It was one thing, however, to concede that the peace terms
were unworkable; it was something quite different
to precipitate a general election in the hope of mending
them. The coalition survived the Paisley election, when
Mr. Asquith was drawn to Westminster through an avenue
of cheering crowds; it survived the awkward questions
which the average voter was beginning to frame.
And, so long as it steered clear of another war, it could
disregard the academic questions of sentimental leader-writers
who asked if any one was a penny the better for
war and victory.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’ve had a year to get your new heaven and earth
into working order,” said Philip Hornbeck, when I visited
him at the Admiralty on the anniversary of the armistice.
“I’ve been tied here so much that I’ve entirely lost
track of the millennium. It’s arrived, I suppose?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A number of people haven’t heard of it yet,” I answered,
with my thoughts on the filibustering expeditions
of the last three months. D’Annunzio had revived memories
of Garibaldi by seizing Fiume and defying the great
powers to turn him out; admirals and generals of the old
<span class='it'>régime</span> in Russia were being supplied by amateur strategists
in England with arms to crush a revolutionary government
in a country that had never been successfully invaded
since the coming of the Tartars. “If the allies had
an agreed policy .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You can’t have an agreed policy when you’re not on
speaking-terms with a single one of your neighbours,”
Hornbeck retorted. “I invited your friend Lucien de
Grammont .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He won’t come if he knows I’m here,” I interrupted.
“And I don’t know that I’m very keen to meet French
people at present.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was twelve months, to a minute, since Violet Loring
pointed out to her boy the men who had come from
Rhodesia and Japan, Portugal and Vancouver to die in
a common cause.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I offered van Oss as a bait,” said Hornbeck with a
grin. “If you three high-minded idealists can’t make a
millennium, you mustn’t get impatient with the rank-and-file.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was a matter for congratulation that a party so
rashly collected could meet and scatter without a scene
of violence. Clifford expected, quite obviously, to be
castigated because America would not sign the covenant
of the League; Lucien, no less obviously, looked only for
a chance of castigating me because I criticized the treaty
in every issue of <span class='it'>Peace</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t quite know what we’re celebrating,” he muttered
provocatively, with a morose eye on the gathering
crowds in Whitehall. “The loss of the war?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We haven’t lost it yet,” I said, “but some of us are
doing our best. I wish you’d explain to me, Lucien, how
you expect to make Germany pay for the war when you’re
standing with your foot on her throat.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am sorry if we are keeping you from trading with
her,” he answered with icy politeness, “but security is
as necessary to France as trade is to England. You
made <span class='it'>yourselves</span> secure when you took the German fleet.
Now, when France is left alone .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He glanced malevolently at Clifford van Oss and turned
again to the window.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But, hell, Wilson had no power to commit us!” Clifford
protested. “If you’d any of you gotten down to the
constitution of the United States .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I fancy America signed the treaty?,” said Lucian
coldly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’d best quit talking about bad faith,” Clifford
recommended, without, however, following his own advice.
“Clemenceau and Lloyd-George let up on Wilson
over the fourteen points; they let up on the Germans
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I turned to Hornbeck, whose square face was alight
with malicious enjoyment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What are you supposed to be doing nowadays?,” I
asked, as we strolled up and down the room where we
had worked so long together.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m adviser to the secretariat,” he answered. “What
does that mean? Well, you may say, if you like, that I’m
preparing for the next war.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s a pity there’s no one to bang all our heads together,”
I murmured, as a new wrangle broke out between
Clifford and Lucien. “The German menace has
gone, but there’s a French menace coming. Nine or ten
months ago I told Lucien in Paris that his people were
at the top of their prestige; now they’re the most hated,
feared and despised people in Europe. A mad war, a
mad peace .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And nothing to prevent another war as mad,” Hornbeck
began. Then we stood without speaking, in a silence
that spread over London, freezing sound and movement.
The customary rumble of traffic receded to a distance and
faded away; the blare of horns, the ringing of bells, the
click of typewriters, all the shouting, speaking and whispering
that made up the unceasing drone of a great city
now, for two minutes, ceased. Then, very far away,
the rumble of traffic began again. I felt as if I were recovering
consciousness after an anæsthetic. Nearer at
hand I heard voices, then the scuffle of feet; a typewriter
clicked interrogatively, as though wondering if the two
minutes were over; then a telephone-bell rang; and the
city heaved and roared its way back to life. “We’re no
better off,” Hornbeck resumed. “Only you sentimentalists
ever thought we should be.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I had been indescribably awed by that sudden silence
and by the spectacle of those many thousands all stricken
motionless at the same time. The street was a solid
block of devout, bare-headed humanity; from the Victoria
Tower to the National Gallery a single mood of
gratitude and reverence bowed those myriad heads. Far
from Westminster, far from London, the same silence
had fallen, the same devotion had risen from a myriad
other hearts.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Spiritually?,” I asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not in the very least! A great many people were
very brave in an emergency; a great many people always
are very brave in an emergency. A great many people
have suffered .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. shall I say, on behalf of civilization?
A great many people always suffer on behalf of civilization,
which is a wasteful and cruel business, George, only
one degree less wasteful and cruel than barbarism. This
wasn’t the first war in history; people like you have
always looked for a spiritual regeneration; you’ve never
found it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I should be content,” I said, “if one man in ten out
of all that crowd would join me in making future wars
impossible.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I should be content if one man in all the world would
tell me how that’s to be done.”</p>

<h3>5</h3>

<p class='pindent'>I reached Fetter Lane in a chastened mood; and for
the rest of the morning we talked of the year that had
passed since Armistice Day.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was to be no United States of Europe, still less a
United States of the World. The peace-treaty, to the
view of us all, indicated the swiftest and surest way to
another war; and there was no influence, outside parliament
or within, to modify it. Trade depression was attracting
attention to unemployment and taxation; but, of
a hundred men who said “We must cut down expenditure,”
ninety-nine added “You can’t touch pensions, of
course; or the army and navy; or the air force.” .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
And, after nine months, the one political organ that
looked beyond the cheap scores and cheaper promises of
the 1918 election was read by a growing literary public
for the sake of its musical notes and dramatic criticism.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Are we addressing the right people?,” asked Jefferson
Wright.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Any person who’ll listen is the right person for me,”
said Bertrand sententiously.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then why not speak to labour?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Because it’s no more opposed to war than any other
class,” grunted Bertrand. “If it were, there’d have been
no war in ’14. When your German workman mobilized,
the British workman had to mobilize against him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The labour party kept us out of a war with Russia,”
Wright interposed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Would the labour party keep us out of a war with
France if the French turned nasty? If you’ve the guts
of a louse, it’s human nature to resist a threat,” said Bertrand
with more rhetorical force than biological accuracy.
“How can we stop people putting pistols to other people’s
heads?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The discussion, like so many in these inconclusive
months, ended with the evaporating discovery that we
were all late for a meal. I drove to the O’Ranes’ house
in Westminster with the now familiar feeling that we
should waste our strength and temper until some force
more potent than our mild and scholarly articles came
to rouse the country out of its drunken sleep. My uncle
reminded me that we had been through one period of
incredulous apathy for half-a-dozen years before 1914.
Then the only people to think a war possible were the
militarists who, with the best intentions, precipitated it
with their preparations and their talk of “inevitability”;
the Disarmament League alone tried to make it impossible,
as duelling was made impossible, by taking away the
privilege and the means of private vengeance. What we
had done then we must do now.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But in 1919,” I said, as we parted, “I am older and
more easily discouraged than I was in 1909.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Barbara had come up from Crawleigh Abbey to make
the acquaintance of Sonia’s new baby; and, as I strolled
up and down the long library with O’Rane, I asked him
how he enjoyed being the richest commoner in England.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I can’t say I’ve noticed any difference,” he laughed,
“except in the number of people who think they’ve a right
to be supported by some one else.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And the millennium?,” I pursued in a fair imitation
of Hornbeck. “The civic conscience? Man’s natural
right to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What would you do in my place?,” he asked. “I’m
almost certain to follow your advice.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>As he spoke without irony, we beguiled the first part
of luncheon with the sort of conversation that is affected
by somnolent house-parties on wet afternoons. As at
Cannes, each of us spent his money in dizzy flights of
imagination; but now he brought us to earth with the
criticism that we were not spending “for the good of
humanity”.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Which was Stornaway’s condition,” he reminded me.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And, in O’Rane’s hands, it was a condition that we
could not fulfil. When Barbara spoke of the incurable
cripples left by the war, he enquired why humanity should
be relieved of its obligations. When I talked, as so often
before I had talked with Deryk Lancing, of universities
and institutions for research, of libraries and museums,
of travelling fellowships and exploration funds, of subsidized
opera and national newspapers, of model cities and
a country made perfect, he applauded my enthusiasm and
asked what I was doing to give it effect.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I do my modest share,” I said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And, if I take that responsibility off your shoulders,
you’ll only have more money to .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. <span class='it'>waste</span> on yourself.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I cannot recall that the tone or choice of language was
more vigorous than I had long been accustomed to hearing
from O’Rane. Certainly I should have taken up the
challenge without concern, if Sonia had not rushed superfluously
to my assistance. Her indignation, however, in
demanding why personal expenditure should be called
waste, warned me against taking sides in a family
quarrel.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“David’s <span class='it'>impossible</span> about money!,” she cried. “So
long as I have <span class='it'>one</span> crust of bread, <span class='it'>one</span> dress that would
disgrace a scarecrow .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If this is how the poor live, let’s join them!,” interposed
Barbara pacifically.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In spite of herself, Sonia laughed as she saw us admiring
her frock. The house was unpretentious, but it
was enviably comfortable. I never wish to be given
better food or wine. And, on a lower plane of morality,
whatever she lacked from her husband was made up
by the munificence of her friends.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s so difficult, when every one thinks you’re
rich .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.” she began.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But it isn’t our money,” O’Rane objected.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Another explosion was threatening; and, at a sign from
Barbara, I ranged myself beside Sonia.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re entitled to pay yourself a salary,” I told him.
“As chairman and managing-director of a trust-company
with a capital of twenty-five millions, I think five thousand
a year .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m pretty sure Sonia will do less harm with it than
I shall,” he sighed. “Is that <span class='it'>all</span> the advice you can give
me, George?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well,” I reminded him, “I told you at Cannes not
to touch the money with a pole.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And, as I told you ten minutes ago, I should almost
certainly follow your advice if you repeated it. Sonia
won’t let me talk about that, though .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Tell me your
plans for the winter. The south of France again?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>By the time we left, the last echo of discord was
hushed. On our way home, however, Barbara warned
me that new trouble would break out if some one did
not create a diversion. I hardly know what difference
Sonia and her friends expected O’Rane’s inheritance to
make; but she was bitterly and undisguisedly disappointed
by what she regarded as a life of wasted opportunities.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Get your mother to invite them out to Cannes,” Barbara
suggested; and I sent an invitation that night on
my own responsibility.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was refused, rather tartly, on the ground that David,
as we might have known, would not leave his work and
that Sonia, as we might have guessed, would not come,
“trailing clouds of infants”, without him. I comforted
myself with the reflection that, whatever her provocation,
she would not try to repeat an effect by running
away; and then I dismissed them both from my thoughts
till the crisis in my own life should be passed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The word, I think, is not too strong for a moment and
an event that were to test the union of two people who,
on any reasoning, ought never to have married. Good
friends though we were, Barbara had never pretended to
be in love with me; I could judge of all that she was
withholding when she forgot to hide her love for Eric
Lane. Though he was five thousand miles away, she was
still haunted by him; and I sometimes wondered whether
anything short of his death would cure the obsession.
Then, on the day when she told me that she was going
to have a child, I took hope again; what I had never been
able to achieve was to be brought about by our son. She
had decided that it would be a boy; we had even chosen
his name; and I had begun to love him, before he was
quickened, for drawing us together.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As Lady Crawleigh wanted Barbara in the country, I
spent most of the early spring by myself in London; and
at the end of April I went down for a week to be at
hand if I were needed. It was the twenty-first of the
month when I arrived; and, though the date is of no
interest to any one, I am unlikely to forget it; my car
crossed the bridge into the abbey precincts at twenty
minutes past seven in the evening, and I am not likely to
forget that either. I shall not forget the eerie silence in
which the abbey was wrapped, nor the scared faces of the
servants, nor the darkness of the rooms, nor the atmosphere
of disaster impending. I hope I am as self-controlled
as my neighbour, but I seemed to feel a hand of
ice on my heart as the butler helped me out of my coat
and murmured that he believed his lordship was in the
garden.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Everything all right?,” I asked as carelessly as I
could.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, sir. Lady Barbara is in her room. I believe
her ladyship is with her.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>When I went upstairs, Barbara was in bed. The blinds
were down, and a closing door hinted that my mother-in-law
was for some reason hurrying away to avoid me.
As I crossed the room, Barbara told me to stop; and, as
I tried to ask how she was, I was waved into silence.
Then she covered her eyes and turned away:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’ve not been told? It’ll be a shock, but I wanted
to tell you myself. I’m sorry, George .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I
did my best. You mustn’t be <span class='it'>too</span> dreadfully disappointed.
Dead .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. He was born dead. If only it could have
been the other way round!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mercifully, as though she had been listening at the
door, Lady Crawleigh came back to say that my father-in-law
wished to see me. Together we drafted the announcement
for the press; and I asked whether it would
be prudent for me to go upstairs again. He said “yes”
and “no” alternately, concluding on a “yes” in the frantic
hope of getting rid of me. As I tapped on Barbara’s
door, I heard Lady Crawleigh scuttling through another;
and it was Barbara, undaunted and indomitable, who hid
her own agony under a gentle concern for me.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I suppose people will want to sympathize,” she began.
“May I have all my letters sent to you, George? Open
them, answer them. I shall have to be here for some
weeks, I’m afraid, but I’ll make up for deserting you
when I come back to London. I’ll give some lovely parties
for you. We shall be so busy we shan’t have time to
think. I <span class='it'>want</span> to keep busy.” .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And, on that word, her dead child, her suffering and
her disappointment were banished from Barbara’s life.
Three years have passed since that April evening of 1920
when we made our compact of silence; and, with a single
exception, we observed it with equal scruple on both sides.</p>

<h3>1</h3>

<p class='pindent'>Before we settled in London for the summer of 1920,
I asked Bertrand whether he was prepared to run our
paper without me if I could persuade Barbara to dull
the edge of her grief by coming round the world with me.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’ll be leaving us,” answered my uncle rather
blankly, “just at the moment when life is becoming
normal after the war. We’ve hideous labour-troubles
in store; unemployment .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. From all I hear, there’s
going to be an explosion in Ireland.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And this,” I interrupted, “is what you describe as
normal conditions after the war?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bertrand nodded slowly over his clasped hands:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I do. A peace-treaty you may regard as another
aspect of war: the last chapter, if you like. Then you
come to that which remains: the bill that’s still unpaid
when you’ve counted your dead and disbanded your
armies and dismembered your empires. All the complications
of our spiritual convalescence are before us.
Still .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I might have spared him my importunity until I had
approached Barbara. With the choice of six months in
London and twelve on a steamer, she had no difficulty in
making up her mind; and I soon found myself studying,
in her company and from a somewhat different angle,
“that which remained” in London after eighteen months
of armistice and peace. If the life was a little bewildering
and sometimes more than a little uncongenial, that—as
Bertrand would have said—was part of the unpaid
bill.</p>

<h3>2</h3>

<p class='pindent'>“One swallow may not make a summer,” said my
cousin Laurence, when his long-suffering sister banished
him from Loring House to the admittedly inferior amenities
of Seymour Street; “but one duchess is going to
make a season. Eleanor Ross has decided that London
is again to be the metropolis of England.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“For that,” I said, “you must blame the prime minister.
It’s one thing for her to keep open restaurant in
Paris, it’s quite another to play round-the-world-in-eighty-days
with an international conference. San Remo,
Hythe .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>In a few months I might have added Boulogne, Brussels
and Spa, so swiftly did one final settlement follow on
another. The hangers-on, meanwhile, had abandoned the
pursuit and returned to London. A season, of some kind,
was opening; and poor Barbara was giving the first of
those “wonderful parties” which were to make her forget
our recent tragedy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Any one who ever had any money seems to have
spent it,” said Laurence with irrelevant regret and an
appraising glance round the table. “I suppose <span class='it'>you</span> don’t
know of a decent job? Something with a bit more money
and a bit less work than the bar?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>If I had, I told him, I could have filled the position
fifty times over with the men who were being thrown
on to the labour-market as the last regiments returned
home and the last war-departments were dismantled. I
hesitate to say how many men like my brother-in-law
Gervaise I helped into lucrative billets in the first six
months of peace; I can say without hesitation that in
1920 I looked vainly for a single position that I could
recommend to the pathetic, unspecialized men and boys
who sent me testimonials beginning: “<span class='it'>Public school and
university ex-service officer</span>, 1914-1918, <span class='it'>wounded</span>.” .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
If others received half the appeals that came to me, the
city was packed close with them; and the only man of
my acquaintance who benefited by this congestion was
the enterprising Sam Dainton, who expanded his agency-business
into a colourable imitation of highway-robbery
by making a corner in empty houses. The premiums
which he imposed and the commissions which he accepted
light-heartedly from vendor and purchaser would probably
have landed him in the dock if he had remained
longer in this kind of business; but vaulting ambition
tempted him to compete with more experienced brigands
in buying surplus stores from the government, and the
blackmail which he levied on the homeless may have been
balanced, with poetic justice, on the day when makeshift
houses were erected below cost-price from the forced sale
of his unmarketable stocks.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nobody could want <span class='it'>less</span> work than you do at the
bar,” Philip Hornbeck pointed out.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I call that mocking a feller’s misfortunes,” replied
my cousin with dignity. “I’ve a good mind not to tell
you now.” .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. As we said nothing, Laurence pulled
his chair close to mine and helped me to a glass of my
own madeira. “These devastated areas, George: they’ll
need the hell of a lot of building material. If you’ve
any capital lying idle .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My trustees see to it that I haven’t,” I answered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ready money’s gone out of circulation since the millennium,”
explained Hornbeck; and for once I almost
agreed with him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In these months I was indeed reminded of the embarrassing
first days of hostilities, before the Treasury began
to issue its own notes. Houses, land, stock-in-trade were
visible and tangible; we could have rubbed along somehow
under a general system of barter; but no one seemed
to be blessed with cash. The owners of big fortunes
made in the war, so useful a year earlier in buying unmanageable
estates, disappeared as suddenly as they had
emerged: a few, I fancy, were frightened by talk of a
retrospective levy on their profits, but most of them derived
their wealth from industry; and industry at this
time was being attacked by creeping paralysis. Sir John
Woburn’s group of papers set up a cry for economy;
the ‘coupon’ system of electioneering was thrown into
its first practical discredit by the success of independent
‘anti-waste’ candidates; and, when my political barometer
told me that all this talk of ‘reconstruction’ was
well enough, but that we must reconstruct the whole of
Europe, I felt that the logic of facts had done what the
pleadings of <span class='it'>Peace</span> would never do.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At my own table, though I had achieved an ingenious
double revenge by placing Dainton, who feared my uncle,
within earshot of my uncle, who despised Dainton, I did
not feel justified in pointing political morals; and it was
with outward cordiality that I listened to his diagnosis
and treatment of international prostration.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The <span class='it'>whole</span> of Europe,” he repeated. “No good
tinkering. Take Germany. Take Austria. <span class='it'>Take
Russia.</span>”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And, with that, he lowered his voice conspiratorially
and invited me to join a concession-hunting syndicate
which the alert Sir Adolf Erckmann was forming. The
proposal surprised me, inasmuch as a sense of personal
unworthiness, stronger even than my impatience of Dainton’s
politics, had frightened me away from Rutland
Gate since Lady Dainton chose it for her second blooming.
Whenever I failed in an excuse to dine elsewhere,
I seemed to pick my way through the melancholy ruins
of fallen European dynasties. Starting with refugee
Russian princes, the Daintons extended the net of hospitality
to catch expropriated Poles and were only waiting
for a change in public sentiment before opening their
doors to the crownless heads of Germany. All were
welcomed with the ceremony which England accords to
the runaway scions of a kingly house: Sir Roger received
his guests in the hall with a braver display of decorations
than etiquette warranted; Lady Dainton curtseyed till I
felt giddy; and, if the throne of the Czars remained
empty, that was only because Moscow was so far from
London.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I had heard so much of the coming royalist counterrevolution
that I fully expected to find Dainton smuggling
arms into Russia.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Your foreign information is better than most,” he
began darkly; and then the plans of the syndicate were
laid before me.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Listening with half of one ear, I seemed—with the
other—to catch the thick tones of Sir Philip Saltash as
he discoursed of the waters which he troubled and of the
adventurous anglers who fished therein. My sleek tempter,
I confess, appeared to me at this moment rather in
the guise of a vulture; and, when I thought of the get-rich-quickly
schemes that were discussed daily in my
hearing, the heavens seemed to darken with these birds
of prey. Sam, with his options on empty houses; Laurie,
with his plans for holding the devastated areas to ransom;
Dainton, with his gambling in marks and francs: all
looked on Europe primarily as a place to loot. Yet two
of these three had offered even their lives so few years
before; and the third had given away his cars and sold
his securities to fit out Red Cross ambulances!</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Are you shaking the bloody hand of the soviet?,” I
enquired, with shocked memories of Dainton’s attacks on
‘bolshevism’.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The soviet? Good heavens, why .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.?” he gasped
with much the same perplexity as his wife had exhibited
when I asked if ministers of religion should be regarded
as paid agitators.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dainton would have nothing to do with the soviet.
Lenin and his gang would, with the help of God, be
brought to book by Admiral Kolchak; but, without waiting
for that consummation, he was ready to help the
commercial recovery of Russia by pouring in goods, machinery
and the material of a new transport-system. As
he could not hope to receive commodities in exchange, he
would be content with gold.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then you’re recognizing the revolution?,” I asked,
as we moved upstairs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Recognizing .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.?,” he echoed testily. “This is a
business deal; politics don’t enter into it. And I shall be
obliged if you’ll keep it absolutely to yourself.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I promised readily enough for the sake of sparing him
the embarrassment of explaining how he could accept
confiscated Russian gold by day and monopolize the despoiled
Russian nobility at night. I did not feel, however,
that Europe had yet been made safe for the amateur
financier. After their last international flutter the Daintons
had let their house in Hampshire; and I imagined
that they, like many others, were trying belatedly to
economize, though Lady Dainton gave another reason
that night for their retirement.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I honestly find no pleasure,” she told me, “in the life
people are leading in London. Perhaps I’m old-fashioned.
The people themselves, don’t you know? .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
I’m not criticizing <span class='it'>this</span> party, of course; but the tone .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
A gigantic beanfeast.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>If she had criticized the party in words, as she was
criticizing it with her eyes, I should have been constrained
to side with her. Old-fashioned or no, I was bred in an
age of strict formality, when Loring House still bore its
hatchment. When I first stayed at House of Steynes, old
Lord Loring hunted us into smoking-suits at eleven
o’clock and assembled us furtively in the billiard-room,
where he plied us with “weeds”, negus and comments on
current yearling-sales. My first London dinner-parties
had the ceremony and pomp of a <span class='it'>levée</span>. In 1920 we had
no time for the ceremony, no money for the pomp.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I suppose a beanfeast is all that people can afford,”
I said, as I contrasted this revel with the gaieties of a
vanished generation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The opera and the ballet were trying valiantly at this
time to make us feel that we were back in 1914; but there
was no public for both. The Crawleighs and perhaps a
dozen others gave their balls and receptions according to
the old tradition; but people who wanted to dance found
the Turf and Stage less troublesome and more amusing.
Those who wished to see their friends could collect them
by telephone at the end of dinner and return from the
theatre to see their houses converted out of recognition.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Twenty people can find money to entertain,” said
Lady Dainton severely, “for one who can find time to
be hospitable.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>As we drifted uncomfortably about the house, I found
it expedient to leave at least this charge unanswered. The
smoking-room was given up to bridge, the dining-room
to an endless supper; musicians, whom in time I came
to suspect our butler of keeping on a chain in one of
the cellars, were imprisoned on a landing: and both
drawing-rooms were cleared for dancing. “<span class='it'>Solitudinem
faciunt: pacem appellant.</span> I’m off,” said Bertrand in bewilderment.
“Promise you won’t invite me again!”
And I shared his bewilderment. The success of the
party, as of the late war, lay in unity of command. Our
butler was <span class='it'>generalissimo</span>; and Barbara asked only that I
would leave him alone. If the men could not find cigars,
they appealed to Robson; when an uninvited guest strayed
into the hall, demanding who the guy was who was giving
this show, Robson introduced him promptly to his
hostess; I saw him supplying powder and carrying out
repairs to torn dresses; and, when our musicians knocked
off work for the night, Robson obliged at the piano,
apologizing for the slow, melodious waltzes of my undergraduate
days and regretting that he had no temperament
for jazz-music.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I <span class='it'>wish</span> I knew his history,” Barbara murmured plaintively.
“I daren’t ask for fear of finding he has a wife.
That would break my heart, because I’m determined to
marry him if anything happens to you, George.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Lady Dainton, meanwhile, was going from strength to
strength of disapproval.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I would sooner give up society altogether,” she announced,
“than countenance its present form. This, of
course, is different,” she added vaguely and without conviction.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mentally, I acquiesced in her condemnation. And it
was not worth while to explain that I assisted at these
beanfeasts because I believed they amused Barbara.</p>

<h3>3</h3>

<p class='pindent'>“This is what remains,” I told Bertrand, when he insisted
on holding a <span class='it'>post mortem</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“These people don’t <span class='it'>amuse</span> you?,” he cried.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They interest me,” I answered. “Looking on, listening
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Since I had given up dancing on the outbreak of war
and am one of the three worst bridge-players in London,
I was thrown back on the delights of conversation; and,
as every gathering included a contingent of Barbara’s literary
friends, I tried to discover what inspiration they
had won from the war. It was soon, however, made
abundantly plain to me that the dangers of this quest
were more apparent than the delights. I was welcomed
at first—I hoped for my own sake—to the little circles
of young writers, who—for want of better accommodation—camped
on the landing and stairs outside my
dressing-room. Soon, however, I found myself being
used as a stick to beat my literary editor for having
beaten one or other of my bitter-tongued guests. When
I refused to help, they took the beating into their own
hands. The “top-hat school of fiction” was flayed by
the “sham-corduoroy school”, the “high-brows” by the
“pin-heads”, the “best sellers” by every one. Shocking
tales of self-advertising were exchanged for dire
revelations of log-rolling; and critics who had been unanimously
condemned a moment before were unanimously
reprieved on condition of their taking service against yet
another school that did not happen to be represented in
our symposium.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Aren’t you perhaps exaggerating the importance of
contemporary opinion?,” I asked as soon as I could make
myself heard. “If the men who praised and blamed
twenty, forty, sixty years ago could read their notices
now, they’d find they hadn’t spotted one winner in five
hundred. If you’re suffering at the hands of irresponsible
reviewers, you’re suffering in the company of Meredith
and Hardy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And then I left the rising generation of writers, who
had slain more reputations in half an hour than my staff
could hope to scotch in six months. Truth to tell, I felt
rather unworthy of their too discriminating society.
Hampstead was so suspicious of Chelsea; Chelsea was
so contemptuous of Bloomsbury; and all three were so
scornful of Mayfair that I thanked Heaven my house
was two hundred yards north of Oxford Street. The
few names that these exotics praised were always unknown
to me; and I was ashamed to admire publicly the
work which they damned so comprehensively. If the
war was to produce a new Elizabethan splendour of
imagination, I saw no sign of it at present: perhaps we
should have to wait a generation till the stench of blood
and the shriek of shells had been forgotten.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Are your very modern friends doing any good?,” I
demanded of Barbara, when our party had dispersed.
“If you were analysing the effect of the war on
art .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“D’you get any reaction from their work?,” she asked.
“In art there’s no such thing as absolute good.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t understand it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And I’m thrilled by it!,” she cried in unaffected rapture.
“All the violence and horror and madness of the
war are reflected in the art of to-day. It’s not pretty,
but it’s true. This party, which dear Lady Dainton hated
so much .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. The restlessness, the hysteria .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Jazz,
in itself .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That which remains,” I murmured, in Bertrand’s
phrase.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I was reminded of the days before the war when revues
and ragtime first established their empire in London.
Then, as the curtain prepared to fall, principals and
supers, the latest beauty and the last comedian, a scene-shifter
or two and the prompter all jigged and shuffled
to the haunting syncopation of the <span class='it'>Honeymoon Rag</span> or
<span class='it'>That Ol’ Mason-Dixon Line</span>. The audience jigged and
shuffled up the gangways; the men were still humming,
the women still working their shoulders when they drove
away. ‘<span class='it'>Oh, honey, I feel funny when dat coon begin to
play</span> .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.’ Now they jigged and shuffled through the
streets and into the houses; they could not stop; life was
become an endless syncopation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I wondered when our friends would settle down. If
the art of the day seemed, in my philistine eyes, epileptic,
it was at least faithful to the epileptic contortions and fitful
mood of the times. Reviewing these stupefying parties,
I see men and women in a high fever. The girls
all wear the same short skirts and exhibit the same bare
backs; they have achieved the same flat figure; and,
granted an upturned nose, they bob their hair in the
same way. Very young, very pretty and very full of
high spirits, they think the same thoughts and express
them in the same jargon with the same loud assurance.
Their sameness makes every party the same. I see myself
talking feverishly of films with some star from Los
Angeles and being told, by little Ivy Gaymer, of the
latest divorce; I see young poets discussing a recent
lampoon and young actresses describing their last triumph.
There are financial groups and political caves;
my cousin Laurence, who has cultivated a knowing and
shrewd manner, runs feverishly from one to another,
nodding, whispering, waving a vast cigar and, I fancy,
rather modelling himself on Saltash. Sam Dainton, who
is beginning to look dissipated, engages in feverish pursuit
of one woman after another. This fever has infected
the women; the divorce-court does a flourishing
trade; no one can remember who at any moment is allied
with whom; and Sam makes overtures to all in the sure
belief that some—and, perhaps, most—will prove to
be complaisant. Sir Rupert Foreditch spreads the fever
among the young politicians.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I can understand that Lady Dainton is too inelastic for
the universal syncopation of these days. I could wish, in
this season of comprehensive toleration, that I were far
more tolerant or far less, for many of these women would
not be received by Violet Loring or my mother, many of
the men would be roughly handled if their business
records were examined by unsympathetic counsel. And
no one can for long live comfortably in a state of delirium.
The clatter from the dining-room and the din
from the musicians’ corner are unceasing. Every one is
moving, talking, smoking at top speed. And Robson
holds all the threads in his capable hands; he is, to
my house in Seymour Street, what Gaspard is to the
Turf and Stage. My house is indeed a small and noisy
club.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is to be hoped that our guests enjoyed themselves;
I believe that they, like Barbara, were only concerned to
be so busy that they could not think. I should not be
surprised to hear that, like Barbara, some of them broke
down before the end. We had intended to stay in London
until I went to shoot with the Knightriders; but early in
July Barbara collapsed suddenly and was ordered to the
country. Though there was nothing organically amiss
with her, Gaisford threatened to throw up the case if
she remained in London.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“When I die, you can tell people I was the only honest
leech you ever met,” he muttered with a frown. “I’m
never afraid to say I don’t know; and I don’t know now
what’s wrong with that child. She’s very ill indeed; and
there’s nothing the matter with her. I have my suspicions.
You’ll go with her?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If I can arrange things at the office,” I answered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Office be damned! If she wants you, go!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>More than a little frightened, I took Barbara to Crawleigh
next day and for a week tried to run our paper by
means of special messengers and an indistinct telephone.
Then I returned to London. The explosion which Bertrand
had predicted four months earlier took place at a
moment when the office was entrusted to the learned and
wholly unpractical Spence-Atkins; and I judged—God
knows how rashly!—that Ireland called to me the more
urgently. I suppose our lives would have been different
if Barbara’s rest-cure had been postponed till September;
if Bertrand had taken his holiday in August, I a month
earlier.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If you <span class='it'>must</span> go, you must,” sighed Barbara. “Will
you open all my letters, as you did before? I’m not to
be worried; and my letters are always so uninteresting
that they send my temperature up two points.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll do anything if you’ll only promise to get well,”
I answered.</p>

<h3>4</h3>

<p class='pindent'>London, on my return, was in what Bertrand called
“its tadpole condition: all head and no body”. The residential
streets and squares were deserted; the clubs and
newspaper-offices were thronged.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I had to cancel leave all round,” he explained, as we
left our dismantled house for dinner at the Eclectic.
“Now that the peace-treaty’s out of the way, the government
is looking for fresh triumphs. Happy thought:
an Irish policy! I felt it was time for us to define our
attitude.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hasn’t it been defined for us,” I asked, “by the impetuous
gentleman who invented ‘self-determination’?
What’s good enough for Czecho-Slovakia should be good
enough for Ireland.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How do you propose to apply it?,” he asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Literally, I told him: by electing a constituent assembly
on universal suffrage and then by enforcing on all Ireland
whatever constitution the assembly framed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But that,” said my father-in-law, who had invited
himself to dine with us, “means coercing Ulster.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>As I felt we could hardly have too many opinions in
our symposium, I urged Frank Jellaby and Carstairs to
join us; and every party was represented by the time that
Roger Dainton pulled a chair to the end of the table.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I detest coercion,” I said; “but, if it has to be applied,
I’d sooner coerce the few than the many. Because
ministers refused to coerce Ulster in 1913, the rest of
Ireland has been coerced ever since. And I never know
why a thing should be called coercion in one country and
‘maintaining law and order’ in every other.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Having propounded my own policy, I was free to listen
while others propounded theirs. Our speeches, at this
date, would make melancholy reading, for every one said
precisely what was expected of him and precisely what
he had said a hundred times before. Writing now at two
years’ remove, I believe and hope that Ireland is on the
road to a settlement; and this dinner two years ago lingers
in my recollection as one more heart-breaking proof that,
if the Irish were incapable of governing themselves, the
English were no less incapable of governing them. Crawleigh,
a former viceroy; John Carstairs, a retired diplomat;
my uncle and Dainton, Jellaby and I, with some hundred
years of parliamentary experience between us, all
talked with the white-hot irreconcilability of Capulets and
Montagues. It was this temper, I reminded myself from
time to time, that kept me exiled from the County Kerry:
it was this temper that tore me from Barbara’s side. In
the years that followed, when I tried to mark the rock
on which my life split, I always thought of this fatuous
debate and of the pale, angry faces round our echoing
table.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was something, I suppose, that no one prayed for
a new Cromwell, though I attribute this moderation to a
doubt whether even Cromwell could now “reconquer”
Ireland and to a fear that those who had drawn the
sword might be the first to perish by the sword. In the
last six years Ireland had made the dire discovery that
the north had won an advantage by threats of violence
and that, if the south wished to redress the balance, it
must employ the same means.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Can’t we cut out ancient history?,” I suggested, as
my patience wore thin. “We need a policy to meet the
present position; and the present position is an evenly
matched civil war.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>As the phrase left my lips, I wondered whether the war
was any longer an even match. Two days before, I heard
from Hornbeck that a mail-train had been held up and
the contents of the lord lieutenant’s bag forwarded, after
perusal, with an endorsement “<span class='it'>Passed by the Censor
I. R. A.</span>”; my agent reported that stores were being
looted and ammunition seized. If attacks on private
persons and on property were still rare, this was due to
prudence on the one side and to intimidation on the
other. Some one, however, would soon be shot because
he refused to be intimidated; the shooting would be
avenged; there would be reprisals against the avengers;
and, worst fate of all, no one would be allowed to remain
neutral.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s begun already,” said Dainton. “That man they
murdered in Limerick .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That spy they shot?,” Jellaby substituted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You call a man a spy for saving British troops from
being butchered in an ambush?,” Crawleigh enquired
acidly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You called Flaherty a spy,” boomed my uncle, “from
your place in the House of Lords. He gave exactly similar
information to the republican troops.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Who were in armed rebellion against the king,” said
John Carstairs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Whose king?,” asked Jellaby.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The dialogue tripped on with the ease that comes of
practice; and most of us were tried players in the farce
or tragedy of mistranslating an opponent’s terms. In the
interests of peace I begged that we should avoid the more
flagrantly question-begging labels; but by now, grown
men though we were, each owed himself the satisfaction
of just one more stab before he laid down his arms.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You know who’s at the back of all this?,” enquired
Dainton, carefully avoiding my uncle’s eye.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The bolshevists?,” Bertrand asked indulgently.
“You said it was the Germans in ’16. It was the
Americans before that. Good God! I’m old enough to
remember O’Connell: it always <span class='it'>has</span> been somebody else!
Will you English never learn that an Irishman’s feeling
is for his <span class='it'>own</span> country? The more you’re pleased to call
a man ‘loyalist’, the more I’d call him ‘traitor’, as I’d
say ‘traitor’ to a Pole who boasted of his ‘loyalty’ to
Russia or Germany.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“As your people <span class='it'>do</span> say ‘traitor’ to the loyalists who
fought for you in this war,” muttered Carstairs. “You’ll
hang them all as traitors, of course, when you’ve got your
republic?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>My uncle was understood to say that he wished to hang
no one; but this laudable restraint won no favour from
the rest.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I should hang Carson and Bonar Law,” said Jellaby,
as though he were ordering a well-considered dinner.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then you must hang Asquith and Birrell for not
hanging them,” said Crawleigh, partly from proconsular
devotion to firmness, but chiefly from hatred of liberalism.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I,” said Dainton, “should be quite content to shoot
de Valera as Casement was shot. Like a dog. Hanging’s
too good for him. President of the Irish Republic,
indeed! It’s treason to the king.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If you’re going to hang for treason, you must hang
for constructive treason, for constructive mutiny and for
acquiescence in constructive treason and mutiny,” I
pointed out: “that brings in the covenanters, the Curragh
people and the Asquith cabinet.” Dainton, I knew,
was a covenanter; and I wanted him to see the implication
of his wholesale executions. “Personally, I don’t
think hanging or shooting ever does much good .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It would have been a good thing,” Bertrand interrupted,
“if you’d shot the entire 1914 House of Commons.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But as a policy for the government in 1920?,” I
asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I have thought over this dinner a dozen times since;
and, when ministers were attacked for permitting the
slaughter and reprisals that followed, I would sometimes
ask their critics if they could do better than the reasonably
intelligent, reasonably well-informed and reasonably
sane men who shewed themselves so crass, ignorant and
mad at this meeting.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“For all the good we’ve done,” I told Bertrand, as we
walked home, “I might as well have been in the country.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t leave me yet,” he begged.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And throughout the late summer and early autumn I
was torn between Barbara’s entreaties that I should come
back to Crawleigh and Bertrand’s reproach that I was
deserting him when he most needed me.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As a study in “that which remained” I suppose these
barren passions claim their place: in our politics, as in
our work and play, our gettings and spendings, our crimes
and insanities, we lived more rapidly, more violently.
The growing disorders of Ireland were ascribed to a
“murder-gang”; in the spirit of the age, they were met
by irregular troops, with general instructions to give at
least as good as they received. Under the reign of reprisals,
there was inaugurated an organized terror for
which there had been no parallel since the first French
revolution. Burning, looting, killing and torturing were
paid back, with interest, in the same currency. Mysterious
and fatal lists of names were passed up and down
the country; the mails were now intercepted at will; and,
when far-scattered, unsuspecting men and women were
done to death by simultaneous blows, a whisper of “spy”
and “counter-spy”—words that had lost their meaning—explained
this opposing secret carnage which no man
had power to stop.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Face to face with this slow bleeding to death, I could
not shrug my shoulders and drift away for a holiday with
Barbara. The peace of the world seemed a madman’s
dream when we could not stop this butchery at our doors.
Day after day Bertrand and I wrote and talked, interviewed
and argued. On one set of lips or another, every
public man was by now branded as a traitor who had
threatened rebellion in Ulster or a traitor who had broken
faith with the South.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If our own statesmanship is bankrupt, we must look
elsewhere,” my uncle pronounced.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For a week he laid siege to the League of Nations, then
to the Foreign Office. Simultaneously I went as a suppliant
to Crawleigh in the hope that he would forward
my petition to the Vatican. On the same day, in almost
the same words, we were told that there was no precedent
to guide a sovereign power in summoning an arbitrator
to settle differences between a government and its
subjects.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You can’t run an empire on those lines,” said my
father-in-law.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re not running an empire on your present
lines!” I retorted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was impregnable. Until the republican leaders
came, like the burghers of Calais, barefoot, in their shirts,
with ropes round their necks, he would not parley with
them; and, unhappily for him, no one was strong enough
to compass an unconditional surrender.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As I walked empty-handed away from Berkeley
Square, I met Hornbeck returning home from the Admiralty.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Making a nice, tidy world for heroes to live in?,”
he enquired with a grin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Though his tone was bantering, it was free from
malice. Philip Hornbeck had no political predilections
and less than no belief in the perfectibility of man. Government,
for him, always came back to a whiff of grapeshot,
which he was always ready to discharge, always
without passion and always without error.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The problem’s <span class='it'>not</span> insoluble,” I maintained. “We
settled Quebec; we settled South Africa. We could settle
Ireland, if we wanted to; but, of a hundred men who
talk of settlements, ninety-nine will only settle on their
own terms.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>On reaching Fetter Lane, I found my uncle at work
on an appeal to the nation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The Foreign Office,” he told me with frozen rage,
“wanted to know what business this was of mine. Perhaps
we can shew them.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>While he wrote, I hardened my heart to the unpleasantest
duty that had befallen me since my marriage.
After the usual enquiries when I was coming down to
Crawleigh, Barbara let fly such a cloud of reproaches
that I was ashamed to finish her letter. A delicate wife
was no doubt a nuisance; but ought I not to have thought
of that before marrying her? Engrossing as my work
was, did I—as a matter of academic interest—rate it
higher than her reiterated request that I should come to
her when she was more ill and miserable than ever in her
life before?</p>

<p class='pindent'>I was halfway to the station when my secretary overtook
me with an hysterical telegram: <span class='it'>If you love me destroy
letter unread</span>; and I should be hard put to say
whether telegram or letter was the more disturbing.
Crawleigh and the local doctor assured me that she was
progressing famously; Bertrand urged me to go with a
vehemence more inhibitive than the strongest veto; and,
in the end, I lamely begged Barbara to be patient and
promised to come at an hour’s notice if she really
needed me.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Peace,” I reminded my uncle, “is only another aspect
of war. ‘The last chapter, if you like’ .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Please God it may be!,” he answered with emotion.</p>

<h3>5</h3>

<p class='pindent'>And, as we spoke, the last chapter was opening.
Though neither of us had paid much attention to the
report that certain political prisoners were being removed
to England, we awoke next day to find that public interest
had been deflected to another part of the battle.
As a football match is suddenly suspended at sound of
the referee’s whistle and the players stand apart to watch
one of their number who has been injured, so the armies
in Ireland, the factions in England, the spectators all over
the world now stood apart to watch one man slowly dying.
The lord mayor of Cork, arrested and imprisoned,
refused to take food. For a week or two, while life still
ticked loudly, we debated over our dinners whether he
had been rightly condemned, whether the government
would let him die of starvation, whether he and his cause
would not be made ridiculous if he were fed forcibly.
Then the contest became more determined: the government
would not yield to a hunger-strike; and Terence
McSwiney, with life ticking now less clearly, would not
yield to the government. It was a question of endurance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Do come here next week-end if you can possibly
manage it</span>,” wrote Barbara. “<span class='it'>This business about the
lord mayor must be decided one way or the other by
then.</span>” .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I could give no promise. The papers were at this time
recording the days of the fast and hunting for stories
of men who had lived for three, four, five weeks without
food. The ticking became feebler; and, one press-night,
when I sat shuffling an obituary, an appeal and a face-saving
leader on McSwiney’s surrender, we heard that
the strike was over. The report was contradicted before
I reached the composing-room. A week later, as the unwound
spring stopped, jerked and stopped again, we were
told that the lord mayor was dead. He was still alive
next day, next week. Sympathy flowed and ebbed. The
government was entreated to spare a game fighter; the
public grew angrily unhappy at being made an accomplice
in this slow torture. Then a gust of impatience blew
against such crazy stubbornness; there followed a flash
of illumination, and Dainton, who would have shot
McSwiney out of hand two months before, asked dubiously
whether an Ireland of McSwineys would be easy
to “reconquer”.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At length the dying prisoner became an institution.
His name was tucked into inconspicuous corners of the
daily papers. There were other claims on the public
attention. At last he died; and we realized that, as the
injured player no longer obstructed the field, the match
must go on.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On the day of the funeral procession I received an
unexpected call from O’Rane, white-faced and enigmatic.
In all the years I had known him I doubt if we had talked
of Ireland a dozen times; but this day stirred passions
older than any he could remember, and I felt that the
taut, bare-headed figure who gripped my arm was saluting
McSwiney’s coffin in the name of his father, “O’Rane
the liberator”. The Irish of London were present in
thousands; but the English watched or followed in tens
of thousands. Some, I well believe, came to salve a restless
conscience; some in homage to a brave man; most
to gratify an idle curiosity. The republican colours fluttered
unfamiliarly in English faces; the way was lined
with English police.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In any other country there would have been a riot,”
murmured O’Rane, when I described the scene.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There will be all the riots you can use when this is
over.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. You’ve been lying very low the last few
months, Raney.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve been thinking. All Lancing’s money .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And ‘the good of humanity’?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes. I believe .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I’ve decided .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. to save humanity
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. from ever touching it,” he answered
slowly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At the time he would say no more; and we spent the
afternoon strolling along one embankment and back by the
other. In the course of our walk, we had a good view
of St. Thomas’ Hospital, if he wished to heal the sick,
and of the Tate Gallery, if he cared to foster the fine arts;
south of the river we walked through streets that were
more sordidly grimed with poverty than any I wish to
see again. There were, I pointed out, inequalities of
wealth for a millionaire to adjust.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But is all this for the good of humanity?,” O’Rane
asked, breaking silence for the first time as we pressed into
his house. The side-door of The Sanctuary was like the
out-patients’ entrance to a hospital; his writing-table was
submerged in appeals to his charity. “You can begin
by adjusting the difference between yourself and those
people outside.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was a sneer in his tone that roused my natural
perversity. I distributed a handful of small change and
returned to find him smiling.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What did you give them?,” he asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“About a sovereign. Whether they’re deserving
cases .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They’re more deserving than you, George. And, if
I’d given Lancing money, I should have been handing
<span class='it'>you</span> a sovereign. That’s my difficulty. Every time I give
to a hospital or a gallery, I’m relieving prosperous people
like you of your responsibilities. If the material good is
outweighed by the spiritual harm .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.” He broke off
to stalk up and down the darkening library with shoulders
hunched and head thrust forward. “There’s still plenty
of wealth in the world. Places like the Turf and Stage
stink of it. And, if people want things badly enough,
they’ll pay for them. If London had a smallpox epidemic,
we should press money on our neighbours to get
them vaccinated.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But, while you’re saving humanity from itself,” I
pointed out, “the money’s increasing automatically.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I can find outlets farther afield. You wouldn’t let
those people starve under your eyes; but you’ll let people
starve to their hearts’ content if you can’t see ’em.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“With a million or two of unemployed here,” I began,
“you won’t be popular.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>As Sonia was in the country, I brought him to dine
with me in Seymour Street. We gossiped until nearly
midnight; and, when I had sent him home, I settled to my
daily duty of opening Barbara’s letters for her. She had
been right, three months before, in calling her correspondence
uninteresting; and, until this night, I had not been
troubled with any doubts which letters to send on and
which to destroy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now I encountered a problem for which I was unprepared.
The first letter referred to an occasion eighteen
months before, when my wife—according to the writer—had
invited him to run away with her.</p>

<h3>1</h3>

<p class='pindent'>I hardly remember when the meaning became clear
to me.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I was reading with but half my attention, when I met
a reference to Croxton Hall, followed by familiar names.
The letter was badly written, in pencil, and more than
badly arranged. The writer had been ill; he was so ill
at that moment that I could not make out the signature.
I examined the envelope. There a different hand had
traced the bold address; I noticed for the first time that
the letter had been forwarded from the Crawleighs’ house
in Berkeley Square; then I saw an American stamp and
understood the faint pencil scratching.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was from Eric Lane; and he was dying as he wrote.</p>

<h3>2</h3>

<p class='pindent'>The shock numbed me; and I read again with so little
attention that I had to turn back in the middle. Then a
second shock drove the first from my mind.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Eric was dying: yes, I realized that. He was bidding
Barbara farewell; and, in my first uncaring glance, I had
seen so much that I must now see all. After losing Barbara,
he had found little inducement to live; and, though
he had once hoped to marry little Ivy Maitland, John
Gaymer had returned—almost on the eve of the wedding—to
establish again his empire over Ivy’s will.
Eric had made his failing lungs an excuse to set her
free:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Two years would have cured me; but I wanted her to
choose for herself. And, when she too dropped out of
my life, I didn’t try to get well.</span>” .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There followed pages of apology, pages of explanation.
Eric’s love for Barbara was consuming him; and,
as the flame died to a pale flicker, he forgot family,
friends and self in desperate prayers for her happiness.
Once more the name of Croxton Hall fell like a black
shadow across his mind. There was an agonized reference
to some rebuff that he had inflicted upon her. Then
came the reason for the rebuff.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was while I was in Ireland that Barbara had gone to
the Pentyres. When the party broke up on the first night—Eric’s
apology could not have been more damningly
circumstantial if he had been indicting her—, she had
concealed herself till he came up to bed, then invaded his
room, finally begged him to take her, take her away. Her
marriage to me was a mistake; I should not want to keep
her when I realized my mistake; I loved her enough to
forgive her.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I remembered, I now understood her distraught questions
whether I should be broken-hearted if I lost her,
whether I was prepared to sacrifice life, honour, everything
to secure her happiness.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the heartlessness and abandonment of that moment,
I knew, as well as if I had seen her, that Barbara was
wholly mad. I recalled the telegram in which she said
that she was missing me; I remembered her loving welcome,
on my return; I heard again her promise that she
was going to make a new start. And then I called up
any self-control that remained to keep me from going
mad too. The child that lay buried at Crawleigh was not
Eric’s. His letter told me that; and, when I found myself
believing his letter, I felt that I was still sane. Barbara
was innocent of everything but a whole-hearted will
and intention to betray me; and Eric had saved her from
that. After he had repelled her, she was innocent of
everything but calculated hypocrisy, sustained triumphantly
for fifteen months. I could never believe her
again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And what then?</p>

<p class='pindent'>A lust for revenge blinded me; and, though I could
hardly hold a pen, I addressed an envelope to Barbara
and thrust Eric’s letter, without comment, half inside it.
Then I thought of him dying in California, by now perhaps
dead. I burned the envelope. As it crinkled and
scattered, I promised Eric’s letter the same fate; then I
hesitated for fear that my lust for magnanimity might
prove more deadly than my impulse of revenge. Was my
life, also, to be a calculated hypocrisy?</p>

<p class='pindent'>I paced up and down the room till a clock struck midnight.
I had lost the post, I realized.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then I looked at the other letters. The first was from
Barbara. If I intended to take a holiday at all this
year, would I not come down to Crawleigh? Thanks to
this Irish trouble—how remote it all seemed!—I had
refused all my shooting invitations; but now that the
McSwiney chapter was closed .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I knew, unreasoningly, that I could not meet Barbara.
Whatever happened to us later, I must have time to think.
I telephoned to O’Rane and asked him to accompany me
on a motoring tour. I believe I told him—I, of all
people!—that he seemed overwrought.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No holidays for me, old man,” he answered with
regret.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I doubt if you’ll find it a holiday,” I said. “I want
to discover what the great public’s thinking about.” .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wish I could manage it .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And then my self-control left me:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Raney, you must!,” I said. “I’m going through the
worst time of my life, something more awful than I
thought could ever happen to me. If you <span class='it'>knew</span> .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You can lend me some pyjamas, I suppose?,” he interrupted
in a changed voice. “I’ll have my gear sent
round in the morning. I’m sorry, George. To the best
of my poor ability, you know I’ll see you through to the
grave and beyond.”</p>

<h3>3</h3>

<p class='pindent'>As I waited in the hall, I drafted a telegram to explain
that I was being called away from London on business.
O’Rane arrived in the middle; and I led him at once to
his room. I could not unburden myself yet; and, as we
drove out of London next day, I found it necessary to
pretend that I was enquiring into unemployment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Bertrand’s afraid the men will get out of hand,” I
explained.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I might have said that in some parts of England the
men were already out of hand. It was at this time that
the “Homes for Heroes” campaign was launched: as
the government failed to provide sufficient houses, a
homeless band of Welsh quarrymen seized a public hall
and announced that they would stay there until cottages
had been built for them. They were led by a man, then
unknown, named John Griffiths, who followed up his
first success by organizing similar raids on any convenient
unoccupied land. No one was paying much attention at
present; as Bertrand said, we were resigned to unemployment
in London, but danger would march hand-in-hand
with winter, when the government declared its
housing-policy and when the official leaders of labour
indicated whether they supported “Griffiths’ landgrabbers.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where are you making for first?,” O’Rane asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Until that moment I had not thought of any destination.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’re half way between Reading and Hungerford.
I don’t know.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I’ve had a bit of a shock; and you’ll
find me rather disjointed.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. God! I don’t know what
I should have done without you!,” I broke out.</p>

<p class='pindent'>O’Rane’s fingers rested for a moment on my arm:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Old man, you knew I was always at hand if you
needed me!” His unseeing eyes softened; and his voice
fell to a whisper:</p>

<p class='pindent'>He paused; and I waited for the rime that should
complete the couplet:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How does it go on?”</p>

<p class='noindent'>It’s .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Chinese, I was told. Two or three hundred
years before Homer.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I drove on, staring drowsily ahead of me at the broad,
unfolding ribbon of black road and the monotonous
water-meadows on either hand. The tender warmth of
the little poem made me forget for a moment the bleakness
of the Kennet valley in late autumn; and, after a
sleepless night, the rushing wind drugged my brain.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I murmured the lines to keep myself from falling
asleep. What had Barbara’s thoughts been when I lay
waking the night before? Suddenly my sight was
dimmed with a curtain of blood; and I stopped the car
in twice its length because I could not see the road before me.
If indeed I had fallen asleep, I had looked for
a moment, through this red curtain, on a sun-washed
verandah, where a dying man was gasping for breath.</p>

</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

<p class='noindent'>The vision faded before I could make out whether Eric
was speaking to Barbara or listening for her voice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The unexpected jolt had flung O’Rane out of his seat;
and, as he pulled himself back into place, he could hear
me stopping the engine.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is anything the matter?,” he asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Eric Lane’s just died.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good God! When?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This moment. I .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. pulled up to avoid him,” I
answered without knowing what I was saying. “He’s
gone now. Poor devil! Oh, poor devil!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>If I was shaken, O’Rane was in no better case:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Those lines .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I had them from him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’d heard him .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I heard him then .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. At least I think .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.” The
road was once more stretching firmly ahead of me to a
belt of leafless trees. In the meadows on either side I
saw deliberate cattle splashing up to their knees in muddy
water. “It’s ten to two, Raney. Shall we see if we
can find a place for lunch?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’ll wait. You’re not fit to drive any more at
present.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. You’d .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. better tell me everything, old
man.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But I’ve told you! I knew Eric was dead or dying
because I had .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I saw a letter from him quite recently.
My nerves are rather jumpy.” .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’ll break poor Lady Lane’s heart,” he murmured.
“And it’ll be a shock for Ivy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Slipping his arm through mine, O’Rane led me into a
field by the roadside. Though he must have guessed that
Eric’s letter had something to do with my frantic appeal
the evening before, I could not speak at present for fear
of breaking down. ‘<span class='it'>Boyish to cry—can’t help it—bad
fever—weak—ill.</span>’ For many moments my head sang
with Mr. Jingle’s clipped phrases. A shock for Ivy?
Some one had told me her marriage was all the failure
that Mr. Justice Maitland had predicted. It would have
been better if she had married Eric: she might have kept
him alive. It would have been better if Barbara had
married him, better if he had never left America, best
of all if he and she and I had never been born.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Babs can’t be ill,” O’Rane murmured as though he
were thinking aloud; “or you wouldn’t be here. Sit
down and smoke a cigarette.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>When he returned with the basket, I was able to tell
him. I wondered at the time, I wonder still, whether I
did right; but I know that I could not help it. He let me
talk myself out, only asking dispassionately at the end:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What are you going to do about it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And I talked myself out a second time, until the fever
left me and I lay back on the rug, almost too much exhausted
to move or think. Physical infidelity, committed
in a moment of passion, stood in relation to this long
infidelity of spirit as a blow struck in hot blood stands
to a calculated and artfully concealed murder. Had Barbara
left me and come back, as Sonia left and came back
to Raney, I believe I could have forgiven her. After
deceiving me once, she could deceive me again; to get
what she wanted, in her own way, she would sacrifice me
as she had sacrificed Jack Waring and Eric Lane.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was all over. And I wanted her desperately. And
it was all over.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hitherto, I had always pretended that there was something
I did not understand in her tragic entanglements:
Jack and Eric were straight as the day; if they both fled
from the woman they both loved, I wished to think that
they were parted by a lover’s quarrel which both were too
proud or obstinate to heal; I refused to believe that they
had run from her in disgust.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m here because Barbara will soon be coming back
to London,” I told O’Rane. “I .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. couldn’t divorce
her if I wanted to; but I can let her divorce me.” .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She won’t be very .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. happy alone,” he answered
reflectively. “When Jack Waring disappeared, she
turned to Eric out of sheer loneliness and misery; when
Eric went, she turned to you. If you go, George, she’ll
turn to some one else. A married woman without children,
without a husband, more lonely and miserable than
ever before .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Well, you won’t have long to wait for
your divorce.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Four-and-twenty hours earlier, I should have called my
best friend to account if he had warned me that Barbara
needed watching. Now she had convicted herself and
robbed me of all temptation to defend her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t see much difference,” I said, “between the
woman who runs away with a man and the woman who
only stays at home because the man won’t run away with
her.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There’s still a difference between the woman who
keeps her reputation and the woman who loses it. When
women become reckless .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. It’s a big responsibility to
give them the first push down the slope.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The short sunlight of late autumn was fading; and I
busied myself with packing our luncheon-basket. As I
had not asked for sympathy, I could not complain if none
was offered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If I give her the chance of divorcing me,” I said,
“I’m not accountable for anything she does after that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was a long silence. Then O’Rane asked:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What will you do?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I had not thought; but, in that moment, I had a vision
of the blue water, the close-packed green woods and the
vivid fuchsia hedges of Lake House.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Go back to Ireland, I expect.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I was making enough clatter with plates and knives to
convince the least attentive that my patience was exhausted;
but O’Rane lay with his hands clasped behind
his head, frowning a little at his own thoughts and wholly
unmoved by my demonstration.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Will divorce make for Barbara’s happiness?,” he
asked in a maddening drawl. “You can’t quite wash
your hands of a woman you’ve married. You weren’t
content, you see, with somebody of your own mould.
Your wife had to be brilliant, beautiful, romantic,
tragic.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. You married Babs when you knew she’d
been shaken to the depths of her soul by Jack Waring,
when she’d been broken to the bottom of her heart by
Eric Lane.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I thought she’d had so much romance and tragedy
that she’d be glad to settle down quietly.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“When she wasn’t in love with you? Has any one
settled down quietly after gambling with death for nearly
five years?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’d have forgiven anything if she’d told me!,” I cried,
as we went back.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We must have driven for an hour before he spoke
again:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, George, if you want my advice, I should recommend
you to burn Eric’s letter and pretend you’ve never
seen it. Then begin again at the beginning.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You imagine I can forget it?,” I asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If you think more of her and less of yourself. The
bigger the crime, the more she must have been tempted:
try to understand that instead of counting up the things
a man has a ‘right’ to expect of his wife. Rights here,
rights there! <span class='it'>Every one’s</span> thinking too much of his individual
rights, George! Every group of nations, every
nation, almost every man and woman.” .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<h3>4</h3>

<p class='pindent'>After two years I can appreciate O’Rane’s patience
better than was possible at the time. I know now that
he was distracted by a civil war of his own; but I was
too much preoccupied to enquire why Sonia and the children
were in Hampshire; I should have been aggrieved
if any one else had presumed to be unhappy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I suppose it’s all the same to you where we spend
the night?,” I asked, several hours later, as we paused at
a sign-post.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the gathering dusk I could distinguish nothing but
the gloomy contours of Stonehenge and the sharp, black
outline of innumerable government huts. Then I saw
O’Rane prick up his ears at the tramp of weary feet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Anywhere you like,” he answered, as a white-faced
army advanced into the glare of my lamps. “I was in
camp here in ’14. It’s a dam’ bad step. Recruits, I suppose.
We should have been given hell if we hadn’t been
smarter than that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>As the column approached, I saw fifty or sixty men in
tattered civilian clothes. Two or three wore medals; the
rest had a brave line of ribbons on their coats. At their
head marched two standard-bearers with the adequate
device: “<span class='it'>Wanted in 1914. Not wanted now.</span>”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They’ve had their hell; and they’re not through with
it yet,” I said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was the first time that I had encountered the searing
reproach of that device; and, as I described it to O’Rane,
I recalled—as in a dream of some other life—that I
was the editor of a political review and that I had been
sent to study unemployment. There was an external
world, then. At this moment my uncle was probably taking
the chair at our weekly dinner.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As the tramp of feet grew fainter, O’Rane half rose in
his seat and then subsided with a groan:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, I <span class='it'>can’t</span>! It’s <span class='it'>not</span> my business to pay other
people’s debts. The state turned these men into soldiers,
in a moment of blue funk; the state must turn them back
into civilians. Sometimes I see so red that I want to
hold this country to ransom. ‘You’ve no use for these
fellows,’ I want to say. ‘Well, now I’m going to shew
you what would have happened if they hadn’t come forward
when they did.’ After a week of Belgian atrocities,
there’d be a marked increase in popular gratitude! And
I thought this war would produce a .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. spirit of fraternity!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I had hoped for it, even if I had not expected it after
the first months of 1915. Quick conversions are never
permanent: and permanent conversions are never quick.
Our drive that day, past great estates and big manufacturing
towns, might have been chosen as an object-lesson
in the aggressive competition that strangles fraternity at
birth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>That night, when we lay at Gloucester, and next day,
as we drove through the soul-searching loveliness of the
Stroud valley, we talked of education and the gospel of
humanity, as we had not talked since our Indian summer
at Cannes; and once or twice, for ten or fifteen minutes
at a time, I forgot to think consciously of Barbara.
H. G. Wells, after years of criticism, was turning teacher
on his own account; and <span class='it'>The Outline of History</span> was conspicuous
in every house and railway carriage I entered
at this time. One man at least was pleading for the universal
spirit; and his plea gave food for thought to the
people who had shouted for blood and gold in the 1918
election. The havoc which Keynes had made in the
economics of the peace-treaty was completed by the havoc
which Wells made of its history and its spiritual trend.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And yet,” I exclaimed in sudden reaction, “those
books have left things where they were!” The treaty,
which could not be enforced, had to be modified: the
British representatives had to explain why their crazy
election-pledges could not be fulfilled. At regular intervals
Germany threatened to default; France retaliated
with a threat of further occupation; a flustered knot of
prime ministers collected at the first convenient watering-place;
and a punctual press announced that the results of
the conference were wholly satisfactory. “I sometimes
despair of education.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. And, damn it, Raney, you
haven’t told me what to do when I get back to London!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’ve not yet told me what you want to do.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
It’s strange how people can hold mutually destructive
opinions at the same moment! Lucien de Grammont talks
piteously about German ‘revenge’ at a time when the
French are pouring Senegalese troops into the occupied
area!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Roger Dainton will tell you that a restored Germany
means a new war and that an unrestored Germany is losing
us our best customer.” .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At O’Rane’s skilled prompting, we argued our way
farther west and farther until, at the end of a week, we
stalled the car and strolled on foot, because we had
reached Land’s End. Surrounded by water, in the spray
and wind of the last rocky outposts of England, I felt my
sanity and self-control returning to me; but a single day
without the distraction of driving brought back the obsession.
I flung myself into a voluminous report on
<span class='it'>Unemployment and Public Feeling</span>, only to discover that
my four folios might have been compressed into the
single word “indifference”. There was no question of
class or party: every one flabbily deplored the breakdown
of industry, flabbily pitied the unemployed, flabbily felt
that somebody should do something. Accent and idiom
might change, but the stale thought and worn expression
changed only by becoming more stale: the wayside tap
echoed the slipshod reasoning of an Atlantic liner; a benighted
book-maker in a forgotten Cornish village talked
of trades unions in a way that I had thought only possible
in my father-in-law; and there were Roger Daintons
manipulating beer-engines in every bar.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I reminded O’Rane of his scheme for endowing schools
and buying papers till the education of an entire people
proceeded from a single pair of lips.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I still believe a press-monopoly is possible,” he answered,
“but who’s to be trusted with it? Horatio Bottomley
is a political messiah to several millions; but I’d
never give a messiah the power of a messiah unless he
were ready to die as a messiah.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Talleyrand’s advice to those about to found new religions,”
I said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Get yourself crucified’? Wasn’t he right? Since
people began to doubt the old heaven and hell, the churches
have been losing their power: they had less to offer, less
to threaten; and their ministers became officials instead of
martyrs. Christianity was born of one martyrdom; and
it will only die when there are no more martyrs. There
were martyrs in the war, if we could only make people
remember them .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But the war’s over,” I interrupted. “How can you
keep that exaltation alive in time of peace?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The question was unanswered when I turned the head
of the car, next day, towards London. We were both
shirking our private difficulties; and, though we argued
endlessly about the world as we wished to make it, the
shadow of our own narrow troubles darkened that free,
generous concern for humanity which we talked so eagerly
of inculcating in people whose narrow troubles engrossed
them no less blindly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’d better tell Sonia we’re on our way back,” said
O’Rane. “If you’ve any idea where we shall be to-morrow
morning, I’ll say she can wire to the post-office.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is she at Crowley Court?,” I asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes. Remember taking her down there the night
Tom’s death came through? She’d put her eyes on sticks
for you over that, George.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She was at her wits’ end, poor child,” I began.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then, whether or no he was spreading a snare for me,
I thought of Barbara by herself at the Abbey, reading of
a “well-known playwright’s death” and stumbling blindly
through the dim, panelled rooms in vain search of some
one to comfort her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We can go back by way of Crowley Court,” I said.
“I’ll send Babs a telegram. If she’s still at the
Abbey .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m entirely in your hands,” said O’Rane.</p>

<p class='pindent'>That night we lay at Exeter; and next day we headed
for Southampton. As we got into the car, I was given
a telegram from Barbara:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>All well here hope you are enjoying yourselves can you
possibly return by way of Crawleigh I need you.</span>”</p>

</div>

<h3>5</h3>

<p class='pindent'>Only when I was committed irrevocably did I realize
that I had not decided how I was to meet her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I can’t pretend for five minutes,” I said. “I never
could.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She’s .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. entitled to see her own letters,” O’Rane
suggested. “You opened this at her request .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But, good God, man, she’s my wife!,” I broke out;
and, remembering the sustained deceit of these fifteen
months, I could not trust myself to say more.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We drove our last stage with heavy hearts. Southampton
was shrouded in the first fog of the year; and, when
it lifted on the confines of the New Forest, I saw bare
trees, dead leaves and all November’s decay. Every few
minutes O’Rane asked me what point we had now
reached; and I knew that for him too every turn of the
road was marked by a memory and guarded by a ghost.
Through eyes half-closed I could see Jim Loring and the
Daintons striding, three abreast, on a leave-out walk from
Melton to Crowley; I could see Eric Lane piloting me
through Lashmar village to call on his father.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
Strange! Though he was now dead, though I had almost
loved him and though we had both been punished for
trying to play a game according to its rules, I could not
forgive him for flinging this last shadow across Barbara’s
life, I could not whisper his name without a shudder.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As we drove through a country that was haunted with
the shades of our dead selves, I fell to thinking whether
a man was happier in the discontent of eighteen or the disillusion
of thirty-eight. I no longer aspired to Westminster
Abbey and a nation’s gratitude; but, like other men
on the threshold of middle-age, I made the discovery, incomprehensible
to a schoolboy, that I had no heir to
shelter himself under the trees which I had planted; and
love seemed almost to have been left out of my life.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In Crawleigh village, my nerve broke and I headed for
London; then, for very shame in the reproach of O’Rane’s
silence, I turned, though I knew that no love was awaiting
me here, and splashed through the floods to the Abbey.
Neave was fishing perfunctorily by the bridge and volunteered
to take the car up to the house if I wanted to look
for Barbara.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The guv’nor’s in London for this Unknown Soldier
business,” he explained. “So it’s only the four of us.
Just right for a nice game of cards.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How’s Babs?,” I asked, as unconcernedly as I could.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, fit as a flea,” he answered. “She’s wandering
about the park, waiting for you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I made a pretence of hurrying forward as the car shot
ahead; then, as it passed out of sight, I leaned against
the parapet of the bridge till the low grey line of the refectory
wall deepened to black and was gradually lost in
the oncoming tide of darkness. I was still there when
the first rare lights twinkled at the windows and paled as
the curtains were drawn. Then I heard a distant whistle
and turned to the house before my impulse to hurry away
got the better of me.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I was halfway to the gardens when I saw the white
coil of Barbara’s furs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Darling! I was expecting you hours ago!,” she
cried. “Did you have a breakdown? I hope I didn’t
upset your plans by asking you to come here, George: I
wanted you most awfully.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I could not see her face clearly; but her voice thrilled
me till I had to bite my lip and look away. I wondered
how I had existed without her all these weeks. The long
rest had given her back her old vitality. Her eyes, when
we entered the hall, were shining; and for a moment I
fancied that I was seeing her in a vision or that I was
emerging from twelve days’ delirium.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My <span class='it'>dear</span>!,” I cried; and she laughed with childlike
exultation at my joy in her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Pleased to see your deserted and ill-used wife?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Babs .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.” Her cheeks were pink from the biting
cold outside; her hair and eye-lashes were spangled with
tiny raindrops. As she flung her coat aside and twined
her arms about my neck, a familiar, faint, warm fragrance
rose from the carnations at her waist. As she
clung to me and our lips met, I could have fancied that
no other man had ever made her heart beat so quickly.
“I’ve never <span class='it'>seen</span> you like this before!,” I cried.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve been getting well .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. for <span class='it'>your</span> sake, sweetheart.
I’ve been so patient, so good. And I <span class='it'>did</span> miss
you so.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve been thinking of you day and night,” I answered
truthfully enough.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The next time you go away, I’ll tell your secretary to
send me a daily telegram: ‘<span class='it'>Missing you dreadfully best
love George.</span>’ You’d never do it on your own account.
What’s the matter, darling?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Unconsciously I must have drawn away from her embrace.
The delirium was returning; and I could only
think of the telegram which she had sent me the day after
she asked Eric Lane to run away with her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Some bad news, I’m afraid. I didn’t want to spoil
our first moment together, but you’ll have to be told some
time. I’ve not seen any papers .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Barbara’s hands fell from my shoulders; and she
walked slowly to the fire.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. <span class='it'>have</span>,” she whispered; and her head drooped
as though I had struck her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You mean .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. what .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. what <span class='it'>I</span> mean?,” I stammered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As she turned, her eyes were blinded with tears; and
her hands groped for support.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Darling, if it had been any one else, should I have
had to say ‘I <span class='it'>need</span> you’? .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. When I saw the great
cruel headlines, I hoped and prayed that I might die .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
till I knew you were being sorry for me. You’re all I
have; and I promised myself I’d repay you for all your
patience.” She could go on no longer; and her terrible
tearless sobbing shook her till I feared that her heart
must break. “I <span class='it'>can’t</span> be brave any longer.” As she once
more hid her face against my chest, I could feel her whole
body trembling in the last vain effort to restrain her
weeping. “When .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. when .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. when did you hear?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Twelve days ago,” I answered, as I led her to a chair.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The day he died. You .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. didn’t tell me, George.
Did you think I shouldn’t see?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Strictly speaking, I didn’t hear for certain. I knew
he was dying .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There was a long article in <span class='it'>The Times</span>. Oh, so
<span class='it'>cold</span>! .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I knew he was terribly ill. That’s what
made <span class='it'>me</span> so ill this summer, though I couldn’t tell you
before. I thought you might guess; the doctor did. I’ve
been going up and down, up and down, as he got better
or worse. The afternoon he died I fainted; and they
all thought I was dead too. Now you understand why
I wrote such horrid letters: as he slipped away, I couldn’t
bear myself. I <span class='it'>did</span> try to keep it all to myself. I knew
how I hurt you by talking about him. But no one told
me anything! .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I couldn’t ask Lady Lane for fear
she’d say I’d killed him. And he died before I could ask
him to forgive me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Barbara was no longer trying to control her tears; and
I was no longer thinking of anything but a means of
comforting her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He didn’t feel there was anything to forgive,” I assured
her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah, that was the way he talked!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It was the way he thought, Babs.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then he might have spared me this!,” Barbara broke
out. “Just one word!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>As her head fell forward, I knelt down and chafed her
hands.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He may have been too weak,” I said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A message, then! I can’t <span class='it'>bear</span> it! I didn’t think he
<span class='it'>could</span> be so cruel.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>In furious self-scorn, I remembered telling O’Rane I
could not pretend for five minutes that I had not received
Eric’s letter. Very little more than five minutes had
passed since Barbara and I met.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In justice to him,” I said, “there <span class='it'>was</span> a message. I
was paraphrasing it. He never dreamt you needed his
forgiveness, he was begging for yours. He loved you as
much at the end as he’d ever done. His last words—so
faint I could hardly read them!—were ‘God bless
you’. And we must assume that he died at peace. You’d
forgiven him so often, he said, that, if God was disposed
to judge him, he believed you would intercede.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>In her agony of spirit, Barbara’s thoughts were reflected
as clearly as if she had spoken them. Her eyes
lightened for a moment in unutterable relief; they
clouded as she looked suspiciously to see if I was inventing
this opportune comfort; then she stared through
me and past me to Eric’s death-bed six thousand miles
away.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. wrote to you?,” she enquired after a long
silence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I half nodded; but, with Barbara’s eyes on mine, I
could not put a lie into words.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The letter was to you,” I said. “I opened it with
the rest.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was a single piteous whimper. Then she looked
at me in perplexity:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where is it? Why didn’t you tell me?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s in my despatch-box.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I didn’t want to harrow
you, darling. I think he was delirious part of the
time.” .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Will you get it for me?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve told you all that matters. It will only make you
miserable to read it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She seemed not to have heard me; but a strangled
laugh, more terrible than her crying, shewed the worth
of my comfort:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“D’you think anything can make me more miserable
than I’ve been these last twelve days?,” she asked. Then
she tore herself from me and stood with her hands
pressed to her temples, staring at me in mingled bewilderment
and rage. “All the time .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.? And you .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.?
The last thing he ever wrote .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. oh, I might have
reached him while there was still time! When did you
get the letter?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Just before I left London.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“While he was still alive .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Ah, God, the cruelty
of kind people!” With the tears still wet on her cheeks,
she forced a smile. “And you’ve been carrying it about
ever since? George dear, you’ve punished me for all the
crimes I’ve committed and all that I shall never have
time to commit if I live to be a thousand.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. May I
have my letter?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>For an instant, as she stood limply drying her eyes, I
thought of telling her that I had destroyed the letter;
then I saw that this would never be forgiven me, even if
I had not already told her that it was with my other
papers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It will only hurt you to read it,” I said. “Forget it!
Forget <span class='it'>him</span>, if you can. I’ve told you he had nothing but
love for you .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then why mayn’t I see it? George, I don’t understand!
I’m not a child; and, if I didn’t know you were
trying to spare me, I could almost kill you for your
ghastly kindness. Pocketing it for twelve torturing days,
as though it were a bill! Pretending he was too weak
to write! Saying it was a <span class='it'>message</span>! You’ll send me mad
if you’re not careful!,” she cried hysterically. “For the
last time, please give me my letter.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“For the last time please try to forget there ever was
a letter. I’ve told you he must have been delirious when
he wrote. I won’t answer for the consequences if you
read it. All this time <span class='it'>I’ve</span> been trying to forget it.” .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class='pindent'>My voice told her all that I was trying to hide. Her
eyes were startled, then compassionate, then defiant. I
thought I heard a whisper of ‘Poor George’. She raised
her eyebrows as though to ask what I was minded to do.
Getting no answer, she shrugged her shoulders and turned
wearily to the fire:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Was that why you left London?” I said nothing.
“You told me it was on business. And you’ve been .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
sitting in judgement on me ever since.” .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I took a step forward and tried to catch her hand:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It has made no difference.” .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Put it down to my curiosity!,” she taunted. “It’s
not pleasant .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. to be .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. <span class='it'>condemned</span> unheard; but
I couldn’t <span class='it'>bear</span> to be acquitted. Your despatch-box, you
said?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Babs, I implore you!,” I cried, as she moved to the
bell.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re afraid of being certain?,” she interrupted
scornfully. “I’m only afraid of sheltering myself behind
a dead man.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Oh, Henry, Mr. Oakleigh wants his
despatch-box. And will you see that there’s a good fire
in the tapestry-room and have his things moved in there?
The .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. peacocks make so much noise on my side of
the house,” she added.</p>

<h3>6</h3>

<p class='pindent'>As I finished dressing, Barbara tapped at my door and
came in with Eric’s letter in her hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If you want this, I must give it you back,” she began.
Her voice had almost left her; and the radiant vitality of
an hour before had flown. “I hope you won’t have to
quote it, because these things are so terribly vulgarized in
court. Do I .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. have to be unfaithful? I wasn’t .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
with Eric,” she added carelessly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know you weren’t.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I meant to be, .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. if I must use that .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. unclean
word. For one moment I had a vision of perfect happiness,
I forgot everything else.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. It would be generous
of you to say you won’t use this. Eric’s dead. And
people would think he was to blame.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I certainly shan’t use it. Barbara, why are you talking
like this?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Before she could answer, the letter had to be thrust
into safety. Then, with one hand clutching it to her
breast, as though Eric’s heart were beating against hers,
she looked up and forced her mind on to my question:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Because father’s coming down to-morrow, and we
must decide what we’re going to do. We had to fight him
pretty hard to get married, but we shall have to fight much
harder to get divorced.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But no one has mentioned divorce.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>I</span> have. You said you could never forget that letter.
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. It was a great risk for us to marry; but you
were so sweet and I was so miserable.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I see now
that the thing never had a fair chance while Eric was
alive. I heard his voice in the streets, wherever we’d
been together, when I knew he was the other side of the
world; and, as soon as I had a chance, I rushed to him.
When he wouldn’t have anything to do with me, I <span class='it'>did</span>
try once more to make a success of our life. You wished
for a son; and I did my best, though Eric was the only
man I wanted as father of my children. Perhaps that’s
why I .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. couldn’t keep him alive, poor mite.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
It’s funny that little things should cause such big troubles.
If I hadn’t asked you to open my letters, we <span class='it'>should</span> have
made a success.” .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was a moment’s break in her terrible composure;
and she turned away with a single dry sob.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why didn’t you tell me, Babs?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You wouldn’t have understood; you don’t understand
now.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If I hadn’t understood .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. a little, should I have
come?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Unwittingly, I moved a step forward; and she held up
her hand against me as though I were assaulting her:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If you’d understood, you wouldn’t have waited twelve
days.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I was goaded beyond discretion by the scorn in her
voice. I had understood and forgiven too little, it seemed,
when I fancied that I had forgiven and understood too
much.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It was .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. a startling letter,” I answered in her
own measure. “Whenever you told me you’d try to forget
Eric .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You wondered for twelve days whether you could
ever trust me again.” She did not trouble to look at me,
but I felt myself flushing. “As though any other man
could tear my heart out of me as Eric did! Why <span class='it'>did</span> you
come?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Because <span class='it'>I</span> needed <span class='it'>you</span>.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Barbara’s lip curled in derision:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Your servant’s too useful to discharge, so you pretend
you haven’t caught her stealing! When we met to-night,
I noticed a difference. I thought you must have seen in
the papers about Eric’s death. When you kissed me so
tenderly, my heart leapt; and I thought you really understood.
Now I know .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The incisive scorn cut deeper as her failing voice died
away.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You <span class='it'>need</span> me because I’m a woman. That’s why you
insult me with your forgiveness. And that’s why you
must divorce me, George. We’re divorced in spirit; and
we should both be dishonoured if we put your <span class='it'>need</span> in
the place of love.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the distance I heard the gong booming for dinner.
Neave’s door opened and slammed. A cautious footfall,
accompanied by a warning whistle, told me that O’Rane
was making his way downstairs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I shall not divorce you,” I told Barbara, “even if I
could. And I can’t. You’ll be as independent of me in
Seymour Street as if you were on a South Sea Island.
But we mustn’t do anything irrevocable till we’re more
cool-headed.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. this is impossible!,” Barbara cried.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If we find it impossible, I shan’t try to keep you.”
As I followed her down to dinner, I wondered whether
we either of us realized what we were saying. “Coming
here to-day,” I told her, “I was thinking that life only
becomes intolerable when there’s no love in it. If I can
get back to the state we were in a fortnight ago .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’ll never do that. You’ll be very kind and attentive,
as you always are; but I married you because I
thought you understood. Now you’ve become like any
other man who puts a cushion at my back or tucks a rug
round my knees. I’m utterly, utterly indifferent to you!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>On this, the first night of what she called for two years
our “life in a gilded cage”, I was chiefly concerned that
her indifference should be concealed from the sharp eyes
of Neave and the abnormally sharp hearing of O’Rane.
With the same intention or in her usual reaction to an
audience, Barbara sparkled her way through dinner in a
manner that set me wondering whether I had not waked
from another nightmare; but, when we looked for her
afterwards, she had disappeared; and, when I went—as
a matter of form—to bid her good-night, she answered
me through a locked door.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Neave had asked me at dinner how long I was staying;
and, when I reached my room, I found a note from Barbara:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>If I am to come at all, I had better come to-morrow.
Mother has a big party this week-end.</span>”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I sat down in front of the fire and tried to picture our
life on the day after to-morrow. Could Bertrand direct
my paper if I found it necessary to live in Ireland? Was
Ireland tolerable or even safe? Could I afford to keep
two houses in commission if my wife refused to live with
me. And how long would Barbara endure this spiritual
starvation?</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Utterly, utterly indifferent.</span>” I had never been the
romance, the passion, the great love which she still demanded
as of right; even with Eric Lane out of the
way, I could not deck out my humdrum self as a fairy
prince. If I failed in the “understanding” for which
alone she had married me, how was her indifference
ever to be overcome? The whole of our life must be
such an evening as this, when she donned a brilliant
mask of gaiety for dinner and discarded it when she
locked her door against me.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A sudden thought urged me from my chair and sent
me pacing up and down my room. How many other
masks did Barbara employ? She dramatized her life so
richly that, though her grief for Eric was unfeigned, I
doubted if she could resist the temptation to make a
romance out of his death. Had she been still unmarried,
she would have cast herself for a part of inconsolable
bereavement; as I obtruded awkwardly into her scene,
she chose a blend of remorse for the injury she had done
him and of heroic endeavour to forget him in her devotion
to me. Unconsciously, in that queer childish brain that
could never separate sincerity from pretence, the phrases
had formed themselves; the emotion that fed the phrases
had been fed by them. Instinctively she had changed her
attitude and improvised a new part when she heard of
Eric’s letter; and this trick of dramatizing her life was
now so much ingrained in her nature that within half an
hour she was perfect in her lines, her expression and her
whole reading of the part. Henceforward she would
continue to regard herself as “a damned soul”, with the
added damnation of being tied to a crass, unsympathetic
husband and of conspiring with him to deceive her neighbours
as she had deceived O’Rane and Neave at dinner.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I readily believed that Barbara had forgotten half the
agony of Eric’s death in the joy of playing her new part.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But how long is it to go on?,” I asked myself in
despair.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The new part had in some sort been forced upon her;
she could not relinquish it without abandoning her attitude
of moral superiority to one who already believed her
to be morally in the wrong and would believe her to be
yet more deeply in the wrong if she admitted that even
her grand romance had been a piece of play-acting. And
play-acting it had been for half the time! She could have
married Eric if she had dared to admit that Jack Waring
was tired of her, instead of pretending that she was
pledged to him.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Next day the Crawleighs arrived in time for luncheon;
and we returned to London in the afternoon. Our departure
was on the border-line between farce and tragedy.
Muffled in furs and bathed in the warm fragrance of her
beloved carnations, Barbara took her place by my side;
her eyes were shining as when I came back to her the day
before; and her undemonstrative mother was stirred to
exclaim: “My dear, you really <span class='it'>do</span> look very lovely.”
Crawleigh, who had recently met my uncle at dinner
and was overcharged with repartees that had not occurred
to him in time, stood with one foot on the running-board
and emphasized his endless rejoinders with
excited cutting movements of a tremulous forefinger. In
the background stretched the low grey walls of the Abbey,
unchanged since the days when the first marquis criticized
the treaty of Vienna, unchanged since Lord Chancellor
Neave cavilled at the peace of Utrecht, unchanged since
some nameless political abbot pointed the significance of
Crécy and attacked the staff-work at Poictiers. I can no
more reproduce my father-in-law’s arguments than I can
reconstruct those of his predecessors; but I remember
being told that now, two years after the armistice, we
were in a more parlous state than when the war was still
raging.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s what my uncle always tells me,” I answered,
though it was not worth while to remind Crawleigh that
this was what I had been preaching in despised <span class='it'>Peace</span> for
fifteen months. “If you sow the wind, you must expect
to reap the whirlwind.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The reply probably bore no relation to the argument,
but I wanted to get away; and I had not listened to the
argument.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As the car turned out of sight, Barbara flung aside one
mask and pulled another into place. Her eyes lost their
colour; her whole body seemed to grow limp. Appearances
no longer needed to be maintained.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So we returned home, to reap a whirlwind. My trite
phrase haunted me. I wondered who had sown the wind.</p>

<h3>1</h3>

<p class='pindent'>My return home from Crawleigh Abbey brought to my
mind the reappearance of the small boy in <span class='it'>Punch</span>, who,
finding his running-away unremarked at the end of one
whole day, drew attention to it by observing that his parents
had the same old cat. For a single moment, as
O’Rane and I reached Salisbury Plain, I had remembered
that the world was revolving in sublime unconcern at my
private tragedy; then a starless night of misery enveloped
me once more. In London, a fortnight later, I was
amazed to find letters and messages, proofs and manuscripts
from people who seemed still interested in unemployment
or reparations, in the fate of Ireland or the
coalition.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now and for many weeks I thought only of new
means to win back a woman who had become a stranger
to me. After her first declaration of “indifference, utter
indifference”, Barbara never weakened the effect of her
action by talking about it; when I had influenza, she
nursed me as she would have nursed any man who had
the misfortune to fall sick in her house; when she caught
my influenza and aggravated it with pleurisy, she allowed
me to take her abroad to recuperate. No two acquaintances,
sharing the same house, could have lived in greater
harmony; and no woman could have devised a keener
torment than by treating lover, husband or friend as an
acquaintance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Meanwhile, the external world was still revolving.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>I want to see you about these articles of yours</span> .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”,
wrote Bertrand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There’ll be a general election within six months,” Sir
Philip Saltash predicted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>I hoped to find you had knocked some sense into
David’s head</span>,” Sonia lamented.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘I see you have the same old cat’,” I whispered to
myself in astonishment.</p>

<h3>2</h3>

<p class='pindent'>It is a tribute, I think, to our loyalty in public that my
marriage to Barbara was commonly quoted at this time
as one of the very few successful unions in an age of
confessed failures and desperate escapes. Had I imagined
at the beginning that our unreal separation could drag
on for two years, the myth of our blissful harmony would
soon have been exploded. As it was, we drifted. I
thought by day, I dreamed by night, of a romantic reconciliation
that never came. There were moments when
I fancied that Barbara, with her passion for dramatizing
life, forgot her boredom in the excitement of martyrdom.
On some plea, which I do not remember, she gave
up entertaining; and, while the young “London of the
restoration”—in Bertrand’s phrase—went leaderless,
she had the barren pleasure of feeling herself wasted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>By degrees which I cannot recall I was driven to spend
more and more time at my office and to dine more and
more often at a club. Her indifference spread beyond me
to all the men and women who in other days had interested
her; it culminated in her dispassionate efforts to
interest her husband in some other woman. I returned
home one evening to be told that Ivy Gaymer had fled to
us for sanctuary and that Barbara was waiting for me
to say whether we should send her back to her husband
or communicate with Mr. Justice Maitland or wait helplessly
for something to turn up. As Ivy was already in
bed, we could hardly prick her into the street at midnight;
and next morning she ruled out our first two courses by
declaring that she would never again enter the house of
a man who intrigued with other women under her nose
and that her father’s advice and sympathy were limited
to the triumphant question: what else could any one expect?</p>

<p class='pindent'>We decided to wait for something to turn up. I did
not want to be inhospitable, but I wanted still less to hear
Barbara talking about my “little <span class='it'>protégée</span>”. After a
week or two I suggested that there were hotels in plenty
and that Ivy was not without money. Barbara confined
herself to saying that, as I had insisted on the creature’s
staying on in the first instance, it was now my delicate
task to evict her. Following the cowardly expedient of
writing what I was afraid to utter by word of mouth, I
sent a note to Ivy’s room one night, asking what her plans
were; we should, I said, be going down to Crawleigh for
Easter. By ill luck, she was still up; and her reply was
delivered from the foot of my bed, where she sat, smoking
cigarettes, in scantier clothes than women usually
wear in public. If we kept the house open, she would
not in the least mind staying on by herself; her solicitors
were advising a divorce; it was saintly of us to take her
in; and she would not have troubled us if she had not been
in fear of her life. The interview was ended damagingly
by Barbara, who came in to insist maternally that, if Ivy
and I wanted to talk, she must put on a warm dressing-gown.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Though my door was locked against similar conferences
in the future, my next attempt was no more fortunate.
Ivy agreed that she must go and then broke into
piteous weeping. I comforted her as well as Barbara’s
expression of scornful amusement permitted; and, when
the weeping broke out afresh as Ivy began to pack, I
recollected an overdue appointment at my office. On my
return, our guest was still in possession.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She’s cried herself sick,” Barbara told me. “You
can say she must go, George, or you can say she may
stop on; but it’s cruel to keep making her cry.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I want her to go,” I said, without enlarging the field
of debate.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It was a pity you asked her in the first place, if you
were going to turn her out.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I fancy she asked herself.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I thought she was a passion of yours,” said Barbara
in faint surprise. “You made me go to her wedding,
when I hardly knew her.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“At O’Rane’s request: because her father was being
so difficult.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was a pause; then Barbara shrugged her
shoulders.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think she’s rather in love with you,” she murmured.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s very flattering,” I said, “but it doesn’t make
things any easier. Her affections are quickly aroused.
First it was Eric, then Gaymer; now .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You don’t believe it? George, you’re sometimes
rather unobservant. Why d’you think she came <span class='it'>here</span> of
all places?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I should think she was banking on the softness of
your heart or of my head,” I answered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I hardly knew whether to be surprised or not when I
found Ivy still with us next day, but I made no further
attempt to dislodge her. At the end of the week Barbara
went to Crawleigh and I telephoned for a room at the
Eclectic Club. New developments in Ireland kept me
tied to the office at the last moment; and I did not choose
that my wife or Ivy’s husband should be able to say that
the two of us had been alone together. After four-and-twenty
hours’ solitude Ivy discovered that it was possible
to live in an hotel without being tracked by her drunken
and homicidal lord; and the incident closed when Barbara
came into my room, on the night of her return from the
Abbey, with a brief letter of thanks.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’d get tired of her very soon,” she said judicially,
as though I still needed to be saved from myself. “So
would any man. That’s why I begged Eric not to marry
her. I believe you’d be happier, though, if you found
some woman who really interested you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That advice is more suitable for a bachelor than for
a married man,” I pointed out.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Barbara walked to the door in silence, then paused with
her fingers on the handle.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And how long is this going on?,” she asked with a
sigh of utter exhaustion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You alone can say that,” I replied.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The tragic farce had been running for six months and
was to run for another eighteen before the farce was
eliminated and only the tragedy remained. Without
regular employment, I should have gone out of my mind;
and I am thankful that my uncle’s increasing infirmities
threw ever more and more of our work on my shoulders.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was in the spring of 1921 that he despaired openly
and finally of the existing government; it was in the summer
that he called for a change.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Though, mark you, there’s not another man who
could have done what George has!,” cried Bertrand with
the generous appreciation that Jack Sheppard might have
exhibited towards Dick Turpin. “After two years of
power he’s made a tumbledown peace that satisfies no one.
He <span class='it'>hasn’t</span> hanged the kaiser; he <span class='it'>hasn’t</span> made Germany
pay for the war. The League of Nations, which we were
promised, <span class='it'>isn’t</span> functioning; he calls a new conference
every few weeks to settle finally the problems which were
finally settled at Versailles. If that isn’t an achievement
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, admitted!,” I said. “I’m thinking about the day
of reckoning.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>We were walking slowly along Knightsbridge on our
way to one of the weekly editorial dinners; and, as we
approached the French Embassy, I crossed the road for
fear of encountering Lucien de Grammont. My shoulders
were not broad enough to support the load of obloquy
which he kept in reserve for our few, uneasy meetings;
and, though I stated candidly that the French were now
the chief obstacles to peace, I could not persuade Lucien
that it was the prime minister and not the humble editor
of an obscure review who had coaxed the French to open
their mouths and shut their eyes at Versailles. Now that
no sweetmeats were to be had, the French were threatening
to undertake the search themselves.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This was the first bill to be met on the day of reckoning;
but I was not prepared to say that it would be the
last or the heaviest. In Ireland, the practice of wholesale
murder and destruction was being met with reprisals in
kind. Of India and Egypt it is enough to say that we
knew very little, that all we knew was bad and that we
were not allowed to print all we knew.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s my point,” said Bertrand with cynical complacency.
“Any one of these things would have brought
down a government in old days. Take taxation! Take
unemployment!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My one consolation,” I broke in, “is that <span class='it'>no</span> man,
even if damned fools call him a ‘little wizard’, can cope
with all that at the same moment.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll write you an article on <span class='it'>The First Duty of Government</span>,”
Bertrand promised. “And that, some of these
gentry may be surprised to hear, is .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. to <span class='it'>govern</span>.”</p>

<h3>3</h3>

<p class='pindent'>My most vivid memory of my uncle’s subsequent diatribe
was that I declined to publish it. In Ireland or
France, where irony is understood, it would have gone
with a swing; but we were unpopular enough already
without assailing the cherished conviction of the English
that they have a natural talent for self-government. And
this is what Bertrand attempted with artful citations
from any convenient speech in which an English publicist
had asserted that Dervishes, Hottentots, Andaman
Islanders or even Irishmen were unfit to govern themselves.
Could darkest Africa shew such a record of misrule
as we had at our doors? Had Egypt plunged to
bankruptcy with greater recklessness than we displayed?
By the standard of our Indian crimes and blunders, was
not Abdul the Damned unjustly damned? The English
were mistaken, but it was not too late to repair the mistake;
and my uncle proposed in conclusion that the United
States should lend Mr. Herbert Hoover for six months
to organize and run the British Empire Protectorate.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It won’t do, Bertrand,” I said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But isn’t it true?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s too true.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>That, however, was not to say that the English had
enough detachment to relish the truth underlying the
irony. Roger Dainton, on the eve of signing the Ulster
covenant, told me—as an Englishman—that the Irish
would never be fit for independence till they had acquired
respect for law; I had seen Violet Loring whiten to the
lips at the report of a lynching in some southern state
and then regain her colour in a spasm of indignation that
a Quaker had not been shot for refusing to enter the
army. Collectively, I had watched the people of London—and,
for all I know, the people of England outdid them—exhibiting,
at the time of the Pemberton-Billing case, a
ferocious credulity that was not exceeded by the French
in the Dreyfus trial.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, write your own damned article,” said Bertrand.
“If you think you know these people .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I believe that in one respect I understand the English,
among whom I was brought up, better than Bertrand, to
whom they were always a race of despised aliens. What
they lack in imagination they make up in a queer political
instinct. Every one at the Eclectic Club was sublimely
indifferent, in these days, to the case of Egyptian autonomy;
the Amritsar sentences only provoked a desultory
discussion whether “damned black men”, as I heard them
described by Sir Roger Dainton, would not be all the
better for “an occasional dressing-down”. When, however,
national bankruptcy was threatened, I encountered
an instinctive preference for solvency; and, when refugees
from all parts of Ireland flooded England with tales of
assassination and counter-assassination, the British liking
for order at home grew clamant. I remember carrying
back to Seymour Street an official poster in which
recruits were invited to “<span class='it'>Join the Royal Air Force and</span>
<span class='it'>See the World</span>”; an unofficial hand had appended the
grim warning: “<span class='it'>Join the Royal Irish Constabulary and
See the Next World</span>.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s beyond a joke: that’s what it is,” said Robson,
on whom I tried the last of my experiments.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For soul-deadening years, my butler’s sentiment had
been expressed, from different angles, by Crawleigh and
Bertrand, by O’Rane and Dainton, by <span class='it'>Peace</span> and the
<span class='it'>Morning Post</span>. I believe, however, that no change of
heart can be effected by one man or one paper. England
accepted the reformation and acquiesced in the decapitation
of Charles the First when the Robsons of those
days—inarticulate and irrational, for the most part, but
numerous and determined—decided that the unreformed
Catholic Church or the divine right of kings was “beyond
a joke”.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve written my own damned article,” I telephoned
to Bertrand. “I think it’s an improvement on yours.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You <span class='it'>would</span>,” he replied.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t think this government has very long to live,”
I added.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The oldest trick in the bag of a political journalist
is to find out what policy is going to be followed, to insist
vehemently that this policy must be followed and to
take credit for having forced his own policy on a vacillating
and apathetic government. During the war, Sir
John Woburn preached conscription from the moment
when his chief spy in the cabinet had revealed that ministers
were agreed to bring conscription in: the Press Combine
advertised itself for months as the mouthpiece of
that opinion which demanded conscription; and, when the
first military service act was passed, Woburn stood forth
as the giant who had forced the government, in his own
phrase, “to give Haig the men”. I have to guard against
the temptation to employ this trick in writing of our
campaign in 1921. Independently of our prompting,
every one was saying that ministers must govern or go;
and I only realized how far opinion had swung, when
I met the lately ennobled Lord Saltash at a public dinner.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, things are moving,” he began darkly, as he led
me to the Turf and Stage and pointed from an unobserved
corner of the gallery to Lord Lingfield’s customary
table.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I needed a few minutes to penetrate the familiar externals.
My cousin Laurence Hunter-Oakleigh was entertaining
a party of American revue actresses; Sam Dainton
was dancing with Ivy Gaymer; and the inscrutable
Gaspard was watching and ministering with his wonted
resourcefulness and address. It was like going back to a
play at the end of a long run. I felt that they must all of
them have been frozen in the same attitude since last I
looked down on the top of their heads a year before. The
band, which played unceasingly from the moment we arrived
to the moment we left, might well have been playing
for twelve months on end. It was impossible to think of
these sleek heads and slim figures without their Turf and
Stage frame, unless you thought of them as the brilliant,
glossy chorus of mannequins and salesmen in a musical
comedy at the Hilarity in old days. Had they homes?
Had they private lives?</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I see Wister is withdrawing the support of his
papers from the coalition,” I said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, he’s out for an all-conservative ministry,” answered
Saltash. “Foreditch put him up to it; and you
can see they’re trying to nobble Wilmot Dean for their
new ginger-group. The rank-and-file tories don’t want
to drive Ll-G. out, though, till they’re sure of keeping
him out. And Lingfield, who’s leading the rank-and-file,
doesn’t believe they can do it yet, unless Bonar comes
back. That’s why he wants a centre party, to include
Birkenhead, Winston and that lot. It’s interesting, devilish
interesting! The dying lion ain’t dead yet.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What line are you taking yourself?,” I asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A wise man wouldn’t commit himself till the dying
lion was much nearer his last kick,” Saltash answered
with refreshing candour. “If Lingfield’s centre party
falls down, he and Birkenhead and Austen won’t get any
mercy from Foreditch and the men who want an all-conservative
ministry; and, if Foreditch wounds Ll-G. without
killing the coalition, his die-hard tories needn’t look
for office from the centre party. It’s too early to say.
When I give you the hint .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I’m here most evenings,”
he concluded with an affability that rather disquieted me.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll remember that,” I said; and, when the last of
many political crises ended fifteen months later in the
prime minister’s resignation, I made it my business to
dine nightly at the Turf and Stage. I was never a member;
but Sonia, who also was not a member, introduced
me to Gaspard; and Gaspard, bowing from the waist,
assured me in the French of the Midi that Mrs. O’Rane’s
friends were always welcome.</p>

<h3>4</h3>

<p class='pindent'>She was not at the club on the night when Saltash
took me to observe the signs of the times; but I found
her husband talking to Barbara when I arrived home. He
was armed with the notes of an article and wished to
use my paper for an attack on the entire English system
of inheritance and property.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’re hypnotized by 1914,” he broke out stormily.
“We treat the old world like a vast Pompeii, which we’re
uncovering bit by bit. People won’t see that we’re repairing
from copies of old models.” .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’d sooner live in old Pompeii than in new Turin,”
Barbara murmured.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If Pompeii had been paradise in 1914, it would be
an outworn paradise now!” O’Rane, I thought, looked
tired and old, as though perpetual opposition was gradually
wearing him down. “The world changes in seven
years, especially if the inhabitants have spent four of
them withstanding a stream of molten lava. Can you
tell me a single idea we’ve put forward, a single effort
we’ve made to improve on 1914 so that Pompeii shall not
be buried again?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I left Barbara to wrestle with his question while I
glanced at the manuscript article. O’Rane’s own contribution
to the ideas of the new age seemed to be that the
hand of every man must be against his neighbour so long
as unequal wealth made the one arrogant and the other
envious. As human capacities were unequal, wealth must
continue to be unequally amassed for a single lifetime;
but to perpetuate this inequality was to perpetuate the
friction that ultimately lead to revolution and civil war.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re at least consistent,” I said. “On the night
Stornaway died, you told me there was no room in the
modern state for these gigantic fortunes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I doubt if we have room for private transmitted
wealth of any kind,” he answered. “It debilitates the individual,
it demoralizes society. I’m seeing that every
day in my own work.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The subject was too big to discuss at midnight; but,
as his article was avowedly the preamble to a declaration
that he was bent at all costs on saving humanity from the
poison of the Lancing inheritance, I warned him that the
unemployed might break his windows if they heard that
a million a year was going to feed distant Russians when
they themselves had not eaten a square meal for twelve
months. I asked whether his wife approved of the article,
but received no answer. Finally, I returned him his
manuscript with a reminder that I could not stultify my
weekly predictions of insolvency by proclaiming of a sudden
that we were all suffering from too much money.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll try elsewhere,” said O’Rane without resentment.
“I’m sorry, but I’m not surprised. You’re hypnotized
by 1914, too, and you think you can avert another eruption
by treaties and boards of arbitration. They didn’t
stop the war in ’14, George; they never <span class='it'>have</span> stopped wars,
they never will. If you’d change the course of history,
you must change the heart of man.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The more I study the heart of man .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.” I was beginning.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It changes daily,” O’Rane cried. “It changed when
man turned sick at gladiatorial shows and slavery and
torture. It will change again when men find that cooperation
is more comfortable than competition. But
you’ll have competition always—the competition of the
rich with the poor, among individuals and nations, the
inevitable forerunner to every revolution and war—so
long as you crystallize an unequal distribution of wealth.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Write me an article on that theme,” I said, “and I’ll
publish it gladly.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>My invitation and promise were forgotten by O’Rane,
I imagine, as quickly as I forgot his demand that I should
find a new spirit moving on the face of the waters. When
I reached Fetter Lane next morning, I was greeted by
Spence-Atkins with news which made Saltash’s predictions
obsolete and O’Rane’s researches premature. With
or without our reminder that the business of a government
was to govern, ministers were hatching a new Irish policy.
Like most Irish policies, it could be guaranteed to divide
England even if it failed to unite Ireland; and I felt
then and later that the decay of the coalition set in on
this day. Like all new moves in the Irish game at this
time, it was certain to keep me in London when I wanted
to take Barbara to Scotland.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The result of the new negotiations has passed into
history; and from first to last I was narrowly preoccupied
with their effect on my own fortunes. If the
south-west of Ireland became habitable again, I was resolved
to make it my home; and, at the end of many
months’ parleying, I was wakened by a telephone-message
from my uncle to say that a settlement had been
reached. After threatening reconquest, the government
had ascertained that to “reconquer” Ireland would cost
as much and take as long as the last South African war;
those who had preached coercion changed their text to
conciliation; and, as I passed through Inverness, the king’s
ministers were meeting the ministers of President de
Valera on equal terms.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The treaty,” Bertrand’s message ran, “was signed
in the small hours. Outside a portion of Ulster, Ireland
is to be a Free State.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And now,” I answered, “and now .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. now perhaps
we may see home-rule for England.” In 1906 I had
brought a young man’s ideals to Westminster; thirty
years before me, my father had done the same; and ten
years before him, though he might now call his ideals
illusions, Bertrand had entered parliament with hope and
vision. One after another, each in our generation, we
had seen our vision clouded and our hope deferred by
the shadow of Ireland. “May I go home now?,” I asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I can’t spare you yet,” Bertrand sighed. “The
trouble’s not over. There are thousands of Irishmen
who’ve taken a solemn oath of allegiance to the republic
for which their fathers and brothers laid down their lives.
There are thousands of English who will say in every
passing difficulty: ‘I <span class='it'>told</span> you so! Ireland is unfit for
self-government.’ We must preach patience, George.
We must try to sweeten the bitter taste that all this blood
has left on our lips. Lake House can get along without
you for the present.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I was only thinking Barbara and I should be the better
for a change,” I answered with deliberate vagueness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>If I kept my disappointment to myself, I could not
help being disappointed. This talk of peace had suddenly
opened an unexpected vista of escape from the “gilded
cage”; and my single glimpse of freedom convinced me
that I could not continue the armed neutrality which Barbara
had been imposing on me for a twelvemonth. We
must be reconciled or divorced. If we could separate even
for a short time, we might be able to decide what we
wanted. I therefore told Bertrand that he must not count
on me indefinitely; and the old man shewed the wisdom
to give me my change by sending me to America for
the Washington Conference.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“One of us ought to be there; and I’m too old,” he
explained. “I don’t know what stuffing the new president
has inside him; but this is the first serious effort
to undo the harm of the Versailles treaty, and Harding
is the first responsible statesman to say frankly that we’re
all committing financial suicide. You’ll go?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I will,” I promised.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And you’ll take Barbara?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll talk to her about it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And that night I told her of my decision.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Are you expecting me to come with you?,” she asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It will be better for us both if I go alone. When I
come back, you’ll have had time to think quietly .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I can picture you talking to your clerks like this,”
Barbara mocked. “ ‘Your last chance, remember!’ .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To think quietly,” I repeated, “whether you would
prefer me to live in Ireland. Conditions are becoming
normal there .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You must <span class='it'>really</span> decide for yourself where you want
to live,” she answered, without hinting whether she
wished me to live alone.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A week later I sailed from Southampton.</p>

<p class='pindent'>If I had expected to find any striking change on my
return, I should have been disappointed; but I fancy that
I had by now ceased to look for the romantic reconciliations
of the film-world. There was little enough change
anywhere. My father-in-law had given me a farewell
dinner on the night before I sailed; he gave me a dinner
of welcome on the night that I returned. Tempers, I
thought, were a little shorter; nerves a little thinner. The
vague feeling that something decisive must soon happen
reminded me of 1914, when the world expected a cataclysm
and almost hoped for it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And certainly the conference has done nothing to
avert it,” I told Bertrand at the end of dinner.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not the French show-down?,” he asked. “After
this, we can talk frankly instead of gushing about our
gallant allies. We all made grievous mistakes at the
peace conference, George, but it’s the French who are
keeping us from repairing them.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Which will coerce which?,” I asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The question, I could see, was not palatable.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They’ve the best air-force in the world and could lay
London in ruins within a week,” Bertrand growled.
“It’s immeasurably superior to anything we saw in the
war. They can hold Germany down with aeroplanes and
niggers; and, when you ask them why they won’t reduce
their submarines, you don’t get a satisfactory answer. I
can give it to you. They’re going to make themselves
masters of Europe before any one has time to stop them.
They worked against us in Poland, they’re working
against us in the near east.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How do you propose to make use of this knowledge?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It may lead to clear thinking. Why <span class='it'>we</span> should pay
six shillings in the pound to relieve them of an income-tax,
when they’re amassing armaments .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was very little change anywhere. Lady John
Carstairs hoped vaguely that we were not going to desert
our late allies; Violet Loring whispered that it was all
very well for dear Phyllis to preach at us, but America
had deserted every one. I provoked a passing storm by
asserting that all international debts would have ultimately
to be forgiven; and, had any one asked wherein the world
was safer or happier than in 1914, he must have waited
long for an answer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>An hour later, as we drove home, Barbara enquired
expressionlessly whether I had enjoyed my holiday from
her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wanted <span class='it'>you</span> to have a holiday from me,” I answered.
“No, I missed you horribly. I should like to think you
missed me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, why say that?,” she exclaimed with sudden petulance.
“If I could have a holiday from myself so that I
didn’t see how my life has been wasted, if I could lose
my memory .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Dear God, if I could only die!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was no change in her; and I was driven to issue
my ultimatum:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If you’d like me to go away again, I will. And this
time I shouldn’t upset you by coming back. I’ve done
my best; and I’ve failed. We can part friends. If you
want a divorce, you can have it now.”.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Somehow, I don’t see you in the divorce-court,”
Barbara murmured half to herself. “I feel you’d bungle
it. When I wrote and begged you to come back, you
<span class='it'>would</span> .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. by special train.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, the matter is now in your hands,” I said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think you’ve a finer collection of worn-out phrases
than any man I know,” she cried, again without answering
my question.</p>

<h3>5</h3>

<p class='pindent'>“No change of any kind!,” I told my cousin Violet
when we dined with her a fortnight after my return to
England.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Barbara had not mentioned divorce again; and I believe
we were summoned to Loring House with a view to mending
the latest breach between Sonia and her husband.
He, unchanging in stubbornness, had published the article
which I rejected and was threatening to follow it with
others; Sonia, unchanging in tactics, had announced that
she would walk out of the house unless he yielded. Bertrand,
unchanging in the beloved formula which he applied
indiscriminately to cigarette-smoking, Christianity,
<span class='it'>vers libre</span>, welfare-work, side-whiskers and “self-determination”,
explained that this was only a phase, which
one or other or both would outgrow. And Violet, whose
kindness of heart nothing could change, was playing
counsellor and friend of all parties.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We, I suppose,” said Barbara, “are to be the object-lesson
in domestic felicity. When women have married
the wrong men, as Sonia and I did, it’s rather a waste
of time for any one to patch it up.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If there’s been a fair trial,” I said, “you should end
what you can’t mend. Armed neutrality is intolerable.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>From Barbara’s thoughtful look I fancied she was
wondering whether I wanted a divorce in order to marry
some one else.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The trouble is,” she continued, “you never know
who is the right man till you’ve married him. I always
thought you had more perfect understanding than any
man I knew .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Funny!,” she added, as I made no
answer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>No answer seemed possible. There was now no change
in our rare private passages, though I thought the reference
to my want of understanding was dragged in to
close the subject of divorce. There was no change in the
atmosphere of this party. Nearly seven years had passed
since Violet and I last dined together at Loring House.
The noble line of portraits had been reinforced by a black-and-white
sketch of Jim in uniform; Sandy was old
enough for his mother to consult me about schools; but
we were arguing now in the very mood and terms that
we had used in 1914.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wish people wouldn’t talk so much about ‘the next
war’,” Violet muttered with a frown in the direction of
Philip Hornbeck. “I’ve lost my husband; I’m not going
to lose my son if I can help it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The big, softly-lighted room reminded me of my interminable
discussions with Jim and of his own admission
on the outbreak of war that the old governing classes
were played out. I was reminded, too, of the question
that had haunted me in the first weeks of the armistice:
if the order that was represented at this table could not
keep peace or make peace, would it have to give way?</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We talk about the next war,” I said, “because the
combined wisdom of the world has done nothing in the
last three years to prevent it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I suppose the prime minister <span class='it'>is</span> the only man .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.?”
she hazarded.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Every prime minister is indispensable,” I answered,
“till he finds himself on an opposition bench, watching
his successor taking command. Five minutes after
George goes, every one will ask why he didn’t go before.
Every one will discover then the vice of all coalitions:
which is that there’s no one to oppose them. You don’t
expect Curzon to admit that Lloyd-George’s foreign
policy is dangerous?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Can nobody do anything from outside?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The press does its best, but this government is
stronger than the press. Otherwise, Woburn and his
combine would have had George out in the street a year
ago. Your best hope is an intrigue from inside. Ll-G.
was at least equally responsible for the shortage of high
explosives in ’15; yet he put the blame on the others and
broke the Asquith government. It may be done again.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>My voice carried to Bertrand’s side of the table and
roused him from one of his now periodical lapses into
slumber.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If the House of Commons contained anybody one
half as clever, Ll-G. would not now be prime minister,”
he answered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>No change; and no prospect of a change until it was
forced upon us by another cataclysm. It was the public
temper that alarmed me more than any concrete problem
of unemployment or proved blunders of policy. On my
first appearance in Fetter Lane I asked young Triskett
for a sketch of the political position; and the tone of his
reply reminded me disquietingly of the recklessness and
exasperation of 1914.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The prime ministers of the allies,” proclaimed Triskett
with the pomp of a toast-master, “have been meeting
in discord and parting in harmony, without settling
anything. The public, however, me lords, ladies <span class='it'>and</span>
gentlemen, has by now ceased to expect settlements. We
have had a new policy once a week to bring Russia back
into what the poet so felicitously calls ‘the comity of
nations’; a protest once a fortnight against bolshevist
propaganda in the far east; and winged words from the
labour party once a month, when it thinks Winston has
a new scheme for invading Russia. Reparations, my dear
Oakleigh, are rather <span class='it'>vieux jeu</span>: we don’t remind Ll-G.
of his promises to hang the kaiser or ‘make the Huns
pay’; if we did, the French might try to catch us up
for an invasion of the Ruhr. We’re rather short with
the French since the Washington Conference. At home,
you’ll find the prime minister has got a new wind, but
everybody’s very sick of him. Gawd, and I’m sick of
everything!,” he added with his first approach to sincerity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The bitter, neurotic voice reminded me of a night,
some eight years earlier, in my old room, a quarter of a
mile away in Bouverie Street. Van Arden and Jack Summertown
then burst in with the announcement that they
were bored beyond endurance; we must break windows
or light a bonfire in Trafalgar Square. “Sick of everything!,”
they repeated at short intervals. I could not
join in whatever debauch they arranged: it was press-night,
for one reason; and, for another—unless my memory
be at fault—, this was the Thursday following the
Serajevo assassinations, when universal dissatisfaction
sought practical expression. Arden and Summertown
were now dead; but Triskett stood in their place. And
Trisketts, multiplied to infinity, furnished the atmosphere,
the fuel and the spark whereby the world was periodically
set ablaze. The Triskett of an earlier generation had
told his friends in Paris that a bit of a revolution would
at least liven things; he had urged Lafayette to fire on
the mob at Versailles “just to see what would happen”.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I mentioned this fancy to Bertrand and O’Rane at the
end of dinner.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s the revolt against peace, after the incessant excitement
of war,” said my uncle, who had been loudly
regaled with private mutinies for the last hour. Ivy Gaymer
was now in the precarious legal region “between the
<span class='it'>nisi</span> and the absolute”; Sam Dainton had scandalized his
parents by opening a cocktail-bar in Swallow Street; and
Barbara was contemplating a volume of autobiography.
“I’m afraid we’re drifting .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’re refusing to admit there’s been a war,” Raney
struck in. “You can’t expect anything to be the same;
and it’s because I’m afraid to drift that I’m carrying out
a new idea with this money.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>We were not encouraged by O’Rane’s tone to break the
rather embarrassing silence that followed. I had noticed
before dinner that he and his wife had not merely—in
the language of stage directions—“come into the
room”; they had “entered, conversing with animation”.
As we drove home, I asked Barbara whether Violet had
effected a reconciliation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If he publishes any more articles, Sonia will repudiate
them,” she answered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And if he repudiates her repudiation?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She’ll repudiate him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Um. I rather hoped, when I saw them together .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Husbands and wives who get on well in public always
arouse my worst suspicions,” said Barbara. “No,
there’s no change.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I was still pondering our hard-worked phrase when
we re-entered our “gilded cage”; and Barbara had
slipped away to bed before I could ask her whether a man
erred more grievously by doing everything that his wife
demanded or nothing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“On the turf,” expounded my uncle Bertrand, “races
are won by the intelligence of the individual backer. It
is only when you lose that you divide the responsibility
between the breeder, the trainer, the jockey and the horse.
That is why the sporting tipster is the happiest of men.
Why shouldn’t we call ourselves ‘the Brigadier’ and
run a sporting column in <span class='it'>Peace</span>? You and I, George, get
neither pleasure nor profit from seeing our political forecasts
being fulfilled.” .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Perhaps, if we’d backed our fancy .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.” I began.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve backed <span class='it'>Peace</span>,” said my uncle grimly, “to a tune
that would make an unsuccessful racing-stable seem like
a safe investment. I pay tens of thousands a year for
the privilege of casting myself for the part of Cassandra.
We <span class='it'>can’t</span> be so much cleverer than other people .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If we were,” I interrupted, “we might make them believe
what we tell them.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The world believes what it wants to believe,” said
Bertrand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And is quite unabashed when it’s proved wrong,” I
added, as I pocketed the article which I had brought to
Princes Gardens for my uncle’s <span class='it'>imprimatur</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Many months had slipped away since we discussed the
day of reckoning that awaited an opportunist government
and an indifferent country. In the last four months of
1921 and the first eight of 1922 every storm that we had
foretold blew against our doors or broke through our
roofs. By the time that the peace coalition fell, the great
powers were at loggerheads, war was at a day’s remove
and the mutter of social revolution was heard in England
for the first time since the Chartist riots. No one heeded
our jeremiads; and there is little satisfaction now in recalling
our prescience. Indeed, before presuming to lecture
the public, I might well ask myself what hearing I
won from my friends and what attention I paid to my own
warnings. Did O’Rane listen when I told him that his
stubbornness had already alienated his wife and would, as
likely as not, encourage the unemployed to break his windows?
Did I listen when I told myself that, though I had
sworn to have no scene with Barbara, the armed neutrality
could not last?</p>

<p class='pindent'>Did I really believe that the conditions created by the
Versailles conference could only be changed by another
war?</p>

<h3>2</h3>

<p class='pindent'>I am writing so near to the times which I am trying to
describe that I must occasionally invoke the judgement of
posterity. I may be told that my facts are wrong, that I
have distorted them by unintended omissions, above all
that I worked in a false perspective. My only answer
must be that I have written the truth as I saw it, that I
have no thesis to maintain and that my conclusions have
been reached without bias. At the armistice I believed
that we had done with war; when peace was signed, I believed
that another war was being made inevitable; and,
when the peace-coalition fell, I believe that the sense and
conscience of the country rose in revolt against a system
that threatened it with another war. From this standpoint,
the general election of 1922 closed the chapter that
began in 1918 and the book that opened in 1914. If it
did not answer my question whether the old governing
classes could make peace, it gave an unmistakable answer
to those who demonstrated that they could not. So far as
the people of England are concerned, I feel that the
diplomatic moves and counter-moves of this period, the
division and regrouping of political parties, the influence
of the party and press managers and the historical significance
of the Irish settlement or the unemployment
problem were all leading to the upheaval of 1922. If
history admit of beginnings and ends, a system ended with
the end of the 1918 parliament. In using the word
“revolt”, which Louis XVI favoured, I wonder whether
I should not use the word “revolution”, which de Liancourt
substituted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>According to my uncle, the first responsible attack on
the peace-treaty was delivered by President Harding; a
counter-attack was opened by the French, when they stultified
the Washington Conference; and an attack, in reply
to the counter-attack, was launched by the Balfour Note
on inter-allied indebtedness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On the day after it was published, Clifford van Oss
called in Fetter Lane to enquire whether the note was an
overture to repudiation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I should rather call it our reply to the French <span class='it'>non
possumus</span> at Washington,” said Bertrand. “If we pay
our debts to you, the French must pay their debts to us
instead of building submarines against us.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“From what I know of the French,” said Clifford, with
the detachment that some of us found irritating in a
country which had so disconcertingly washed its hands of
European problems, “they won’t take it lying down.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The assertion was so intrinsically probable that I did
not contest it; but, if I spent little time wondering what
the French reply would be, that was chiefly because I was
watching the fulfilment of another prophecy. The controversy
that raged for six months over O’Rane’s articles
in the <span class='it'>Democratic Review</span> is now public, if not ancient,
history; and my chief memory is of his victory by silence.
If one of his million critics had troubled to study his argument,
he would have seen that the flamboyant gifts of
embarrassed millionaires were attacked for their demoralizing
effect on the recipients. Those who wrote to the
papers or passed unanimous resolutions of protest laid
emphasis on the crying needs of hospitals and the like;
they assumed an almost impertinent right to tell other
people how they should spend their money; but they did
not meet O’Rane’s contention that every university could
be endowed, every laboratory subsidized and every great
work of art purchased for the nation from the money that
was spent on luxuries.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I paid less attention to those who lectured O’Rane from
expensive addresses than to those who heard, on the authority
of a millionaire, that a great many people had a
great deal too much money.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Any windows broken?,” I asked him on one of the
rare occasions when we met in these months.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not yet,” he laughed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I did not dare to enquire whether any wives had been
running away lately. Sonia’s threatened repudiation had
not yet been published; but this, Barbara told me, was only
because he had not yet stated in public that he would
renounce his inheritance. The controversy imparted a
transient heat to the chilly summer of 1922; and no
doubt I should still be printing letters of protest if
O’Rane’s theories of property had not been drowned in
the thunder of a more urgent conflict. In August I took
Barbara to stay with the Knightriders; and I had only
reached Northumberland when my uncle recalled me to
London with a telegram that revived for many days the
agonizing fears and uncertainties of 1914.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I returned alone to find Bertrand breakfasting in bed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’ve asked me more than once what we’ve done to
prevent another war,” he began. “Here’s your answer:
nothing.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the last week I had seen but a few provincial papers;
I had almost forgotten the diplomatic moves that led to
this check. With all the suddenness of those August days
eight years before, however, I stepped out of the train at
King’s Cross to learn that Great Britain was being left to
fight, single-handed, for the freedom of the Straits,
against a restored and rejuvenated Turkey.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This is the French reply to the Balfour note,” I said;
“their revenge for our refusing to accompany them into
the Ruhr.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If you’ll be good enough to tell me what it’s all
about .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.” Bertrand thundered; then he lay back, spent
and very old, until I suggested calling in Fetter Lane to
see the latest telegrams.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was nothing to be learned there; almost nothing
to be learned when I invited myself to dine with the
Crawleighs, though I remember this night with pleasure
as the only one on which my father-in-law and I looked on
any political problem with the same eyes. Halfway
through dinner, Neave entered in service-uniform. His
battalion had received its orders for Chanak; he did not
know why he was going; we could not tell him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Harington’s a cool-headed fellow,” said Crawleigh to
keep his own courage up. “If he <span class='it'>can</span> avoid a conflict
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I remembered the days eight years before when Jim
Loring and I kept our courage up by telling each other
that Sir Edward Grey would prevent war if war could be
prevented.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I <span class='it'>still</span> don’t understand,” muttered Lady Crawleigh,
as though we were conspiring to keep some discreditable
secret for her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No one does, ma,” Neave snapped and then left his
father to reach the same conclusion in less few words.</p>

<p class='pindent'>War was again at our gates; and we had not willed it,
we did not want it. Stalking across Europe from that
country which had been most completely vanquished, it
hammered at our gates within four years of the war that
was to have ended war. Whenever in the last three years
I had urged that the incorrigible and blighting Turk
should be forced into the hinterland of Asia Minor,
Crawleigh had annotated my articles with the red-ink
comment that we should pay for a peaceful Europe with a
hostile India. Now, though he knew better than most
men that Mohammedan India was not bound to us by ties
of love, we awoke to find that, while the victorious allies
were quarrelling at a distance, Turkey had set herself
quietly to recover all that she had lost in the war. When
British troops went unsupported to uphold the Treaty of
Sèvres, they were to find their old enemies equipped with
the arms which we had shipped to Russia and restored to
fighting form by officers of the French army.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. but <span class='it'>why</span> .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.?,” Lady Crawleigh kept
repeating with pathetic helplessness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Parliament, as represented by Crawleigh, the services,
as represented by his son, the press, as represented by me,
were not allowed to know all that was involved in this
apparently aimless squabble about distant waterways.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nobody knows and nobody cares,” Neave cried in
ungovernable exasperation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And this was all that I could report in answer to
Bertrand’s request for news.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The first shot fires the magazine,” he predicted; “and
we know from the Balkan wars that people can fight when
they’ve no food and no money. Russia and Hungary will
come in search of pickings. One will bring in another.”
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For once, however, my uncle was at fault. The political
instinct of a somnolent people was again expressed by
my butler in his favourite formula that another European
war would be beyond a joke.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If they can’t do better than that,” he decided, of the
coalition ministers, “they’d better let some one else have a
try.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I handed on this opinion to Bertrand next day, with the
rider that he looked like winning an old bet on the life of
the coalition. Before I went north again to bring Barbara
back to London, the Lloyd-George government was under
sentence; and, had Bertrand been at hand in October to
claim his wager, I should have had to entertain him at
dinner.</p>

<h3>3</h3>

<p class='pindent'>Mindful of Lord Saltash’s invitation, I called without
delay at the Turf and Stage to hear the latest movements
of political parties. Now, as before, there was no one to
turn the prime minister out if he could hold his cabinet
together; now, as before, the insurgents were thrown into
confusion by their cross-divisions. While Rupert Foreditch
ran up and down in search of a conservative leader,
the centre party counted its big guns.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>It is hard</span>,” the Lingfield press stated, “<span class='it'>to imagine a
conservative administration without Lord Birkenhead,
Sir Robert Horne and Mr. Chamberlain, all of whom, it
is well known, have promised their allegiance to Mr.
Lloyd-George</span>.”.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Recent events in the near east</span>,” retorted the Wister
papers, “<span class='it'>have signed the death-warrant of the coalition</span>.”.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The organs of both parties combined to ignore the existence
of liberal ministers; and I judged that the political
wire-pullers on all sides were estimating whether
the old but awkward conservative organization or the
new but efficient coalition would be the harder to
split.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As I failed to see Saltash, I deduced that the tocsin was
either not to ring yet or else had rung already in some
other place; and my nearest approach to a party-manager
was the trim and ill-informed Frank Jellaby, who demanded
without preamble what line my paper would take
in the election.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What line are the independent liberals taking?,” I
asked in my turn. “And how many seats can you be sure
of winning? I’d support the devil himself if he promised
a homogeneous majority.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Our</span> line .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.” he began eagerly; and, as I turned
from the things he had forgotten to the things he had
never learned, I classed him unhesitatingly with those
who—in O’Rane’s phrase—would not admit that a war
had taken place.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I suppose a political whip can’t live without an abnormal
endowment of optimism,” I said, more to myself
than to him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jellaby forged ahead with growing enthusiasm. The
local associations were solidly in support of the Asquith
wing, solidly opposed to the Lloyd-George renegades.
Much capital could be made out of the Safeguarding of
Industries Bill (“which is pure protection; you’d have
thought the tories had had enough protection in 1906”);
more from the Black-and-Tan reprisals in Ireland; most
of all from the unpopularity of the coalition.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But have you considered why it’s unpopular?,” I
broke in at last. “Not because its policy is faintly protectionist—the
electors to-day don’t care tuppence about
free trade—; not because it tried to put down murder
with more murder. What people care about is taxation
and the cost of living and unemployment and, above all
else, my dear Frank, security. We’re in sight of another
and a bloodier war.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“With a man like Lloyd-George .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.,” he began with
a kindling eye.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I did not wait, however, for the end of the tirade. No
one beyond Jellaby’s immediate circle of colleagues cared
about the internecine feuds of exasperated factionaries;
and I look back on this night as the time when so temperamental,
congenital and impenitent a liberal as myself had
to realize that there was at present no hope for liberalism
in the liberal party. So far as the roar of his indignant
rhetoric allowed me, I tried to formulate the demands of
all who shared my own feeling of insecurity. The country
was demoralized by the war and by the paralysis of
government that followed it; instinctively the country
wanted to be put into training, to have its muscles hardened
and—still more—its nerves steadied. Though the
heat of civil war had died down in Ireland, it had been
replaced by the fitful blaze of individual assassination; the
chief of the imperial general staff was done to death this
summer on the steps of his house in London; the commander-in-chief
of the Free State army was ambushed in
Ireland. It was idle to bandy figures of murders and reprisals,
when the country demanded a cure for its own
demoralization.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“People feel it’s time to pull up, take stock, overhaul,”
I said. “It’s the spirit of 1914, when the war did for us
what we could not do for ourselves.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And that security is just what the liberal party
offers,” said Jellaby. “Standing midway between a tory
reaction and socialism .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If you’re going to be the safe, middle party,” I interrupted,
“go all-out for that. In 1918 you had no
policy; you have no living policy now. The only thing
you’ve learnt since 1914 is that you have a score to settle
with the coalition-liberals. While you’re settling that, the
country will look for a government that will tackle unemployment
before the unemployed get out of hand, a government
that doesn’t bring us as near war as we are to-night.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>We argued inconclusively until the theatres emptied.
As there was still no sign of Saltash, I judged that—in
his favourite phrase—he must be troubling the waters to
some purpose; and I was preparing to leave when Sam
Dainton hurried up to demand why I had not yet patronized
his cocktail-bar. He was followed—at an interval
of time and space calculated to disarm the king’s proctor—by
Ivy Gaymer, who told me that she expected her
decree to be made absolute the following week.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“These six months have been hell,” she cried viciously,
as she danced away with Sam.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Marking her difference of outlook and appearance since
she first sought from me an introduction to journalism, I
felt that we were threatened by a worse spirit than that
of 1914 and that we stood in need of harder moral training.
Ivy’s reputation was hanging by a thread; her
fingers and Sam Dainton’s were itching equally to snap it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A mad world,” I said, as I parted from Jellaby. “A
mad world,” I repeated, two days later, when I went north
to bring Barbara home. “A mad world face to face with
its madness,” I thought to myself, on reading an announcement,
sandwiched between news of now greater
moment, that Mr. David O’Rane was withdrawing the
funds of the Lancing Trust from England.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On reaching Seymour Street I found a telephone-message
from Sonia, begging me to see her at once. I replied
that I would come; but, as I walked to Westminster that
afternoon, I felt—as in the similar atmosphere of eight
years before—that the individual had shrunk in importance.
Barbara, shaken out of her usual aloofness,
now only cared to know what chance of life I would give
her brother; and, though I felt for Sonia as I should feel
for a popular actress who married a country curate, I
was mildly aggrieved that she should absorb my time
when I wanted to explore the last frantic hopes of
peace.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The case which I prepared for O’Rane was, I fancy, not
unpersuasive; but I had no chance of putting it forward.
If the inheritance three years before had been a nine-days’-wonder,
the news of the renunciation seemed likely
to cause, in some quarters at least, a nine weeks’ consternation.
I blundered into the wake of a deputation and
entered the library in time to hear the venerable Bishop of
Poplar pleading for men and women whom O’Rane had
kept alive for more than two years. Thousands, the
bishop asserted, were on the verge of starvation; before
the winter, they would be reckoned by tens of thousands.
While Mr. O’Rane’s arguments might be unassailable in
normal times, the aftermath of an unprecedented war demanded
abnormal remedies.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“From half-a-dozen abnormally long purses?,” O’Rane
enquired wearily. “I want <span class='it'>every one</span> to give and <span class='it'>every
one</span> to feel it. If your few rich men go on strike, what
will happen?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The bishop was too old a controversialist to be trapped:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You would like me to say that some one will come
forward in their place. I wish I could believe it. When
the pinch becomes unbearable, the government will provide
relief out of the taxpayer’s pocket. But, before that
relief comes, many people will be dead; there will be
rioting .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s a nice question already how long we can keep ’em
sweet,” interposed an anxious voice on behalf of the
National Unemployment Committee.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s a nice question whether you’ll get anything done
till they turn nasty,” retorted a small man with a Cardiff
accent.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The bishop smiled and explained that, to make his deputation
representative, he had included his friend Mr.
Griffiths, with whose well-known bolshevist views we
were no doubt already acquainted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What would you think, Mr. O’Rane,” he continued,
“if I threw the bread of London into the Thames on the
plea that it would be better for the people to eat cake?
You are pronouncing sentence of death on the weakest
section of the community.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the silence that followed I turned from O’Rane’s
tortured eyes to the apostle of “bolshevism”. This was
certainly my first, though not my last, meeting with the
organizer and leader of “Griffiths’ Heroes”. I had expected
a figure cast in the heroic mould, for there was a
touch of the genius in the originality of his ideas and a
hint of the commander in the obedience which he secured
in carrying them out. Most strongly marked, however,
was the fanatic; and his blended passion and cruelty made
him something less than human. In thinking of him after
all these months I am always reminded of an angry ferret.
He was very small, very hirsute, very quick; though his
eyes were brown, they seemed to shine red; and, as he
looked scornfully round O’Rane’s warm library, I felt
that his little teeth were seeking a hand to bite.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There’d be less talk of bolshevism, if people knew
what they were talking about,” he announced with a bluntness
that was in painful contrast to the bishop’s courtly
patience. “The government says it doesn’t know what
to do; let’s see if any one else does. When folk are starving,
they know what to do.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was a threat in his tone; but he did not explain it,
as Sonia came in at this moment and motioned me into
the corner by the tea-table. Griffiths, to the credit of his
consistency, refused tea: the men whom he represented
had been out of work for eleven months; he lived as they
lived and, if need be, would starve as they starved.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’re first on the list for looting, when the revolution
comes,” she whispered cheerfully, while he examined
her clothes as though he would have liked to strip her.
Then, for a moment, she forgot to think of herself.
“Oh, George! Babs has just telephoned for you. I’m
so sorry, I’m afraid there’s bad news. Your uncle .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”
I stood up; but she pulled me back, as the deputation filed
out. “She’s sending the car here; she thinks you ought to
go to him at once. If there’s anything we can do .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I shook my head. At Bertrand’s age, there was little
that any one could do.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Have you told Raney?,” I asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I hadn’t a chance. This deputation .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Oh, David,
what did you tell them?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>O’Rane dropped into a chair and pressed his fists
against his temples:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I said .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I’d think the thing over. It was really
out of politeness to the poor old bishop. Nothing can
make any difference.”.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Even when everybody tells you you’re wrong? People
simply won’t believe it. I had four reporters within
half-an-hour.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t know what they want to worry us for,” he
broke out. “What did you tell them?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sonia weighed each word of her answer before launching
it:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I said you hadn’t made up your mind. If you want
to shew that you care for me .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>O’Rane walked to her with his hands outstretched in
an attitude of entreaty:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If this accursed money had never come to me, you
couldn’t have said that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The attitude of entreaty won no hint of yielding.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course, if you <span class='it'>won’t</span> be warned .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.” Sonia muttered,
as she walked with me to the door.</p>

<h3>4</h3>

<p class='pindent'>As I got into the car, I was first frightened and then
touched to find Barbara sitting half-hidden in her
corner.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m afraid he’s very bad,” she whispered. “It’s not
a stroke this time; but something’s broken inside him and
he’s had terrible hæmorrhages. If he has another .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
I’m so sorry, George.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It was good of you to come.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the darkness I heard a sigh; and Barbara laid her
hand on mine:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’ve always been good friends, even if we <span class='it'>have</span>
made rather a mess of our lives.” .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I could not hear what she said after that, for I had
been caught unprepared by Sonia and was realizing now
for the first time that it was a toss-up whether I saw
Bertrand alive. My uncle was a man of almost fifty
when I was born. For ten years I was frightened out of
my wits by his huge stature and bellowing voice; for another
ten I was humiliated by his brutal jests and blasting
disparagement; then, as a young man, I rose in exasperation
and trounced him till he roared with delight at my
beating. From that unlikely beginning sprang a friendship
in which Bertrand played the part of father, elder
brother, political mentor and fellow-conspirator in my
most impressionable years.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I .&nbsp;. simply can’t imagine life without Bertrand,” I
told Barbara.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If you want me .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”, she whispered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Did even she know how the sentence would have
ended? I was stunned by the thought of losing Bertrand;
I clutched at any one who would take his place, clutching
literally with both my hands about Barbara’s wrists. And
she, for the first time in my acquaintance, was frightened.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Does this mean .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.?,” I began.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I won’t come into his room, of course,” she continued,
in a superb recovery. “If you want me to fetch some
one for a second opinion .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Does this mean that we’re going to make a new
start?,” I persisted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll do all I <span class='it'>can</span> .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Though it was Bertrand’s imminent death that broke
my self-control, I forgot him and forgot that we were
driving to his death-bed:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The only good you can do is to tell me this ghastly
farce is played out! Two years!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We all make mistakes,” she answered with composure,
though she had winced at that word “farce”. “I
can’t help you <span class='it'>much</span>. In these two years I’ve grown used
to doing without love. I’ve lost everything, thrown everything
away.” The silence that followed seemed to daunt
her; and I felt my hand being pressed. “You know as
well as I do all you’ve done for me. I’ll be your wife, I’ll
bear you children if I can; but I can’t give you a love I
don’t feel.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>As though I had stepped aside, I saw myself lurching
forward to demand satisfaction for the unuttered reproaches
and contemptuous suspicions that had masqueraded
so long as patience.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Did you ever feel it?,” I heard myself asking.
“Have you <span class='it'>ever</span> loved <span class='it'>any one</span>? You’ve been curious
about many people; but it’s always been in your head
and not in your heart.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t let <span class='it'>myself</span> off!,” she moaned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wonder! You have tragic scenes; but, when other
people are broken, you survive. If your heart had been
brought into the play .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I broke off in stark horror. Never before had we held
such language; and we were almost within earshot of
Bertrand. Barbara was dumbfoundered at first; then she
rallied and threw herself into the duel as though I were at
last giving her an opportunity of which she had been unfairly
deprived ever since our marriage.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I never pretended to be in love with you,” she taunted
me.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’ve never been in love with any one. If you’d
ever known the meaning of the word, you wouldn’t have
married me on those terms.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Barbara turned away and covered her face with her
hands.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s the way Eric said good-bye to me!,” she
gasped. “George, I asked you to divorce me two years
ago.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And I wanted to make sure, for your sake. Well,
let’s face reality for once! Imagine me to be dead.” .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class='pindent'>With another unexpected turn, Barbara clung to me
convulsively and laid her hand over my mouth:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t talk of death!,” she whispered. “I’m so
frightened of it! And it’s very near at hand now. I’ve
been ill so often, I’ve had to fight it so often. My dear,
my dear, if I ever heard you were ill, it would bring back
all my love: I’d nurse you; I’d shew you I <span class='it'>could</span> sacrifice
myself. Never say that again!,” she cried hysterically.</p>

<p class='pindent'>My fit of bitterness passed as quickly as it had come;
and I tried to apologize. Then it returned; and I asked
myself whether this talk of “sacrifice” meant more than
that Barbara was living, as ever, in a world of emotional
romance. Then the car stopped; and I stumbled up the
steps of my uncle’s house.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the hall Violet Loring told me there had been no
further hæmorrhages. Only a few more hours of life
could be expected, however; and this Bertrand realized.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I didn’t bother you before,” he began in his normal
voice, “because I didn’t know whether I was going to live
or die. I’m going to die, it seems; and I can tell you,
George, it’s the most interesting experience I’ve ever had.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>His grim chuckles rumbled till the vast Victorian brass-bed
creaked. Involuntarily Violet shivered; but I felt
that the last and least service I could do was to make my
mood chime with my uncle’s.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m glad I’m in time to thank you, Bertrand,” I said.
“You’ve been my best friend ever since we first set up
house here together, nearly twenty years ago.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Though I knew the room of old, I was struck for the
first time by the uncouth masculinity of a vanished era.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Odd business,” he grunted. “I always dropped a
generation. I’m your <span class='it'>great</span>-uncle; but I always put you
in your father’s place. You’ve kept me young.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
And now this is the end, the moment we wait for all our
lives. The heart’s weak, thank goodness, so I shan’t
make a fight; but I swear to you I expect to wake up
again to-morrow morning! I’m not afraid of going out,
but I can’t believe it. That’s why people persist in
fabricating a future life. I’ll tell you one thing, George,
that’ll comfort you: death’s only a terrible thing if it
comes before you’re ready, and you’re only ready when
you’re worn out. That was the terrible part of the war.”
The leonine head turned with an effort that left him
breathless. “Violet my dear, I bow humbly at the
thought of boys like Jim who were killed before they had
time to find the grasshopper a burden. I can’t believe I
shan’t wake up to-morrow, but I don’t want to .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. here
or anywhere. A silly old woman of a parson came here
yesterday.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. It cost me a hæmorrhage to get rid of
him. Good God, I’ve outgrown <span class='it'>that</span> phase! Life
eternal.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I’m much more interested in the brief life
that is our portion here. I’ve had nigh on a century of
it; and I know less about it than I did when I was born.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He paused as the nurse came in to say that O’Rane was
waiting downstairs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good of the boy,” he murmured. “Ask him to come
up.” Then his eyes shone with their last gleam of mischief:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘<span class='it'>Never seen death yet, Dickie? .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Well, now is
your time to learn!</span>’ ”</p>

<h3>5</h3>

<p class='pindent'>The fit of coughing that followed caused my uncle to
examine himself for injuries. The nurse made signs to
Violet, who slipped noiselessly from the room; O’Rane
came in, and I guided him to the bedside. Bertrand
shook hands with difficulty; and his heavy eyes lightened.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re another of them,” he panted. “Always think
of your father when I see you. I wonder what he’d have
made of it all if he’d lived.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. George there?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m here,” I answered, as I pulled a chair to the bedside.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve been thinking over what you said the other day
about our prototypes in history. Triskett’s great-grandfather
firing on the Versailles mob just to see what would
happen.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I’ve known a good few historic figures:
O’Connell; Mazzini; Lassalle. The great unspeakables.
I believe I went to them for fear of being told by boys
like you that I and my spiritual forefathers had been on
the wrong side. Dam’ conceit! I hope I’ve outgrown
that phase now; but, when that ass Crawleigh spluttered
about rounding up conscientious objectors in the war, I
felt that his ancestors had burnt heretics. Your friend
Maitland sentenced a man to the cat the other day: he
said it was the only remedy for crimes of violence. I
asked him why he didn’t break the fellow on a wheel,
as his forebears had done. Damn it, I gave up shooting
for fear of finding myself in the same dock as the old
cock-fighters. Conceit, if you like. I’ve been a radical
because I couldn’t let posterity charge me with the savagery
and intolerance which we throw up against our conservative
predecessors. Time was on my side. I recorded
my protest. What <span class='it'>good</span> it’s done .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.? That’s
why you’d better keep the paper on, George. It’ll shew
the next generation how superior you were to this.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The advice was rounded with a cynical, deep chuckle;
and he lay long without speaking.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The world’s a gentler place than when you were a
boy, sir,” O’Rane put in.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bertrand looked at him in silence for a moment and
then shook his head slowly:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You say that, with your experience of the late war?
<span class='it'>Does</span> human nature change? .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. We shan’t have that
dinner, George, but I wasn’t far out in my date. The
present government is falling to pieces.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And what’s going to take its place?,” I asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bertrand ruminated in silence for some time; then his
face lighted for the last time in a reflective smile:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A restoration government! We’ve given a million
men and heaven knows how many thousand million
pounds to keep things .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. <span class='it'>just as they were</span>. Nurse
says we’re shipping troops again to the Straits: to defend
the graves we’ve already filled there, I suppose. In ten
years the great powers will be balanced as they were ten
years ago; there’ll be the same competition in armaments,
the same scares, ultimately the same universal war .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
on a vastly different scale. At home we’ve fallen back
into our old social and financial grooves.” Bertrand’s
eyes turned fixedly to the ceiling in a strained effort of
concentration. He was speaking very slowly now and
studying his articulation. “We’re .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. going on .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
from 1914 .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. without break of thought .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. or mend
of heart.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>As he paused, O’Rane stood up and walked cautiously
to the bed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll leave you now, sir, unless you want me,” he said.
“I expect you’d like to talk to George. I .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. want to
thank you.” .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’ve nothing to thank me for. Don’t go unless I’m
depressing you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s not encouraging,” O’Rane laughed. “You remember
Anatole France’s story of the woman who tried
to save her lover in the Terror? She gave herself to one
of the judges and was told afterwards that she had .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
rather misunderstood his assurances. <span class='it'>On fera le nécessaire</span>,
yes; but what then? ‘<span class='it'>Je t’ai dit, citoyenne, qu’on
ferait le nécessaire, c’est-à-dire qu’on appliquerait la loi,
rien de plus, rien de moins</span>.’ Most unfortunate misunderstanding!
‘<span class='it'>Elle sentit aussitôt</span>’,” he quoted slowly,
“ ‘<span class='it'>qu’elle avait fait</span> .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. <span class='it'>un sacrifice inutile</span>’.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>As Bertrand looked from O’Rane’s scarred hands to his
sightless eyes, I saw that he had no answer ready. I do
not know what answer either of us could have given such
a man at such a moment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Until the nurse came in with the doctor, my uncle lay
silent and, I think, half-asleep. Towards midnight he
roused with a start and seemed at a loss to explain why
we were there. Then he remembered that he was dying;
and, with the slow effort of failing strength, one hand
was dragged painfully from under the bed-clothes. I led
O’Rane to him and then shook hands myself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That place of yours .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.” he muttered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Lake House. I heard you were selling it. Don’t .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
unless you must. I was brought up there. Your grandfather
and I .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. You’re too young to remember the
orangery .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. When I was twenty, our nearest neighbour
was a girl called Cathleen Nolan .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.” He
paused for breath, and I tried to find out if he wanted to
send her a message. “She’s been dead for more than
sixty years,” said Bertrand with a twisted smile.</p>

<p class='pindent'>If that was his romance, he could tell me no more of it;
and the smile gave place to a quick contortion of pain. I
sent O’Rane for the nurse; but, before he reached the
door, my uncle gave one long sigh and the slight movement
of his breathing ended.</p>

<p class='pindent'>O’Rane carried the news to Barbara and with it a note
to say that I should stay at Princes Gardens until the
funeral. On the heels of the first letter I sent a second
to beg her forgiveness for my mad words in the car. She
replied that she had forgotten everything.</p>

<h3>1</h3>

<p class='pindent'>The days that followed my uncle’s death stand out in
my memory as a vivid and wholly disconnected dream between
two normal periods of waking-life. At one moment
I was living in the midst of vast, conflicting noises;
there followed complete calm, during which I was indeed
as busy as ever—as busy as one seems to be in a
dream—; then the tumult broke out afresh. Though
nothing had in fact been suspended, though nothing had
greatly progressed in my short spell of unconsciousness,
I felt at the time that I had two personalities, one on either
bank of the dividing stream.</p>

<h3>2</h3>

<p class='pindent'>I believe Bertrand’s death saved my life or at least my
reason. I remember feeling almost bitterly that I could
not support his illness in addition to my work for our
paper, the hourly exasperation of my life at home and the
storm of calamities that were bursting on us from the
four corners of heaven at the same moment. The shock
of losing him gave me the break I needed. When I
awoke in an unfamiliar bed, I recalled that we were overshadowed
by a new war, that a general election was imminent
and that unemployment was a problem which we
could not solve “by pulling long faces”. Then I recollected
the venomous, red-eyed author of that phrase; and
the scene in O’Rane’s library was flashed on my brain
like a scene in a film. I remembered Sonia’s jejune
sympathy. I remembered finding Barbara in the car. I
wondered dully how we stood after that bitter, mad outpouring;
and, despite her note, I was thankful that we
should not meet for a few days. Then I realized that for
a few days I should have a respite enforced: from the
paper, from war and unemployment, from everything that
seemed at the moment more than I could bear.</p>

<p class='pindent'>My first duty was to arrange for the memorial service
at St. Margaret’s; and, as I watched the congregation
arriving, I felt that the respite was extending, for an hour,
to all of us. The obituary notices, the memoir which I
was writing for one of the quarterly reviews, most of all
this solemn tribute to a man, perhaps great, of an undeniably
great past turned our thoughts backward to a
time when France lived under a citizen-king and disunited
Germany declaimed ineffectually at Frankfurt. Of the
two former prime ministers who attended the service,
both were hardly more than boys when my uncle first
entered the House; the oldest head of a foreign mission
had found “old Bertrand Oakleigh” an established institution
when he was first accredited to the Court of
St. James; and the journalists, the lawyers, the men of
business, the bees and butterflies of society who moved
sombrely to their places could not remember a time when
the truculent Johnsonian figure had not been one of the
familiar sights of London.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A great landmark gone,” whispered Dainton, as I
waited for Barbara to arrive with the Crawleighs. “I
didn’t always agree with him. Indeed, if you took a
poll of the people here he <span class='it'>hadn’t</span> quarrelled with .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I turned to watch the cars emptying and the new arrivals
dodging or seeking out the reporters. My mother
had come over from Cannes; my sister and her husband,
Violet Loring and Laurence represented the family; and,
if we had all tingled from the old man’s lash, that was
long ago and inextricably in the part he chose to play.
The older generation in the House of Commons and the
younger generation in Fleet Street—men who won his
respect by standing squarely up to him—came unurged
to prove their regard for his fighting qualities and his
generosity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I deplore his politics,” said Crawleigh, “but he was a
great public servant.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>At such a time I refrained from suggesting that Crawleigh’s
father had deplored the politics of Bright and
Cobden. It is one curse of the party-system that an opponent
must be dead before we admit that he may possibly
not be damned. I was brought up to regard Lord Salisbury
as a monster wherewith to frighten naughty children;
my father, if he had been required to expose the
Antichrist, would have pointed his finger unhesitatingly
at Lord Beacons field.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I thought over Crawleigh’s belated tribute as I took
Barbara to our places. This imminent election might
purge the House of those to whom the war—as Saltash
told me frankly—had come as a god-send; but, if the
adventurers into public life were not sent back to their
counting-houses and newspaper-offices and bucket-shops,
I feared that, with Bertrand, there would die an unparalleled
tradition of integrity and devotion. My uncle
had prepared himself for politics by half a lifetime of
study, as Gladstone and Salisbury, Morley and Rosebery
prepared themselves; of the men under thirty who entered
the House with me in 1906, hardly one had not tried to
equip himself by travel, by settlement-work, by experience
in business or by the management of an estate. There
seemed to be fewer servants of the public in 1918.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If he had scoffed less,” said Lady Dainton, “he
would have done more.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I agreed privately, though I think his cynicism covered
a disappointment of soul: he had come to England, as a
brilliant, ambitious and sanguine boy, to reform the
world; and the sluggish-witted, slow-speaking English
had worn him down. To begin as an O’Connell and to
end as “a great public servant” would have roused him
to savage merriment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How he would have despised all this!,” I whispered
to Barbara, as the people whom he would not admit to his
house hurried importantly into the more prominent seats.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ministers of the present and past, divines and pressmen,
authors and diplomats poured in till every place seemed
to be taken. A crowd began to collect at the doors; there
was rather more noise than I thought seemly; and I was
glad when the organ began to play.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sixty years of public life. I was trying to remember
whether Bertrand had known Westminster before the
new Houses of Parliament were built, when Spence-Atkins,
who was acting as an usher, touched my arm and
asked if we had room in our pew for two more. I made
way for Sonia, who crushed past me with scarlet cheeks,
and for O’Rane, who allowed himself to be guided by a
verger. His face, I thought, was white and set, with a
suppressed anger which I had seen more often at school
than in later years. I asked if anything was amiss; but
he would only reply “Afterwards.” Then I relapsed
into the past and forgot my surroundings until the last
notes of the Dead March throbbed into silence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Outside I was surrounded by sympathetic friends; but,
in the complete detachment of my anæsthesia, I was
thinking only that I had time to see my solicitors before
luncheon, when I found Sonia the centre of an agitated
little group which O’Rane was trying alternately to soothe
and to disperse.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, I insist on telling George,” she proclaimed. “Did
you hear what happened when we arrived? I don’t like
being called a murderer!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The word—and, still more, the tone in which it was
uttered—disturbed my dream of past days.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Who .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.?” I began.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then O’Rane, with mounting irritation as some queer
sense warned him that a crowd was collecting, felt for
my arm and led me away.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We don’t want a scene,” he whispered. “I’m sorry,
George: I wouldn’t have come if I’d thought for a moment.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Our
excellent friendship the Bishop of
Poplar is unintentionally at the bottom of this. You remember
his saying something about my condemning innocent
people to death if I stopped the money I’ve been
giving him the last few years? Well, that’s been taken
up by Griffiths’ gang. We’ve had sandwichmen patrolling
The Sanctuary all this week: O’RANE’S SENTENCE
OF DEATH or something of the kind. I didn’t care; I
wasn’t going to be blackmailed. Then, to-day, one of
the reporters at the door asked my name; and somebody
in the crowd overheard it. A few idiots thought it would
be amusing to shout ‘murderer’.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Where’s Sonia?
It’s time we got back.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>As I led him to his wife, I observed that her cheeks
were no longer flushed; she looked, indeed, unpleasantly
scared, and her eyes were fixed on the avenue of loiterers
between whom she must pass on her way home.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’ll drop you,” Barbara suggested, with a quick
movement towards the car.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sonia hurried gratefully to her side.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thanks, Babs, I’ll walk,” said O’Rane obstinately.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then I’ll walk with you,” I said. “This business is
frightening your wife,” I added when we were alone.
“Why don’t you tell the police to clear these sandwichmen
away?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I really haven’t had time. This is going to be the
worst winter of all, George; we must raise every penny
we can.” His lip curled contemptuously at the booing
which greeted us in Palace Yard. “I’m free to beg now;
if people want to know what I’m doing myself, I can say
I’m giving every last shilling I can spare and they must
do the same. We’re <span class='it'>all</span> responsible for relieving this distress;
it’s part of the war, and we must volunteer as
freely as we volunteered in ’14. And, if that doesn’t
bring the money, we must try other means. The smug,
secure people were glad enough to have conscription of
men. Their money’s less than a man’s life; we must have
conscription of wealth if they won’t volunteer. If it
amuses the people I’m working for to call me murderer
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Will you come in?” he asked, as we reached The
Sanctuary.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m already overdue at my solicitors’,” I answered,
though I made time to call at the Admiralty on my way to
the City.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I thought that Philip Hornbeck, who amassed “intelligence”
of all kinds, should have a first-hand account
of this ugly little scene; and I wanted to hear his opinion
of Griffiths. Though he promised to keep on eye open
for the O’Ranes, he clearly considered the temper of the
country less dangerous than in the big strikes after the
war. The unemployed were numerous enough, but they
were kept scattered; Griffiths had the ability and the will
to make mischief, but he was disowned by the official
labour-leaders.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The people of this country have no experience in
revolutions,” said Hornbeck. “When you have a riot,
it’s always the rioters who need police-protection.”</p>

<h3>3</h3>

<p class='pindent'>The tumult, which had seemed to be so mysteriously
suspended, broke out anew on the day when I sent my
memoir of Bertrand to the printers and walked out of
Princes Gardens into the traffic of Knightsbridge. Clamorous
contents-bills at the street-corners reminded me that
I was come back to a world where new wars were imminent;
the Guards had sailed for Chanak; a general
election could no longer be averted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>My ultimate duty to Bertrand was fulfilled when I persuaded
my staff to carry out his last wishes for <span class='it'>Peace</span>.
Though he mocked the empty conceits of recording protests
and demonstrating moral superiority, he was not
scheming to stand well with enlightened posterity when
he lay murmuring: “<span class='it'>Un sacrifice inutile? Un sacrifice
inutile?</span>” O’Rane’s question was an affront to him; he
was wishing himself fifty years younger, to make an answer
that would satisfy him; and we must take up the
burden which his hands could no longer hold.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As soon as I had their promise of support, I left my
colleagues and set out for Berkeley Square to learn the
secret history of the long-threatened conservative revolt.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This menace of war had done what the grotesque treaty
of Versailles, the organized anarchy in Ireland, the paralysis
of government in every limb had so far failed to do.
Others, besides my butler, were saying that the long
record of misrule was beyond a joke; and the party-managers,
in concert with the independent wire-pullers who
were now an established part of our public life, had decided
to wreck the coalition. ‘Blob’ Wister had already
spoken; and Saltash told me that Woburn and the Press
Combine would speak next day.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I found my father-in-law engaged on a letter to <span class='it'>The
Times</span>, protesting against the exclusion of peers from the
Carlton Club meeting; and for a long spell he reiterated
like a sulky child that he could tell me nothing because he
was allowed to know nothing. Then he relaxed and informed
me that the fight was taking place over foreign
policy in general and, in particular, over the prime minister’s
dictatorial habit of conducting his foreign relationships
through his own secretariat over the head of the
Foreign Office.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If I’d been Curzon, I’d have thrown the whole thing
up years ago,” said Crawleigh with that eagerness for
resignation so often exhibited by men who have not been
invited to hold cabinet office.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He may feel he’s more useful as a brake on the
prime minister,” I suggested.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If the prime minister goes, the foreign secretary
must follow .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. unless he precedes him, when he sees
how the cat’s jumping,” said Crawleigh with ill-concealed
malice. “Well, it’s quite simple; Chamberlain has
pledged himself to support the coalition; Birkenhead and
Horne are with him; and the rump is meeting to see if
it can overthrow Chamberlain.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Who’s to be put in Chamberlain’s place?,” I asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No one knows yet. No one has the least idea how the
meeting will turn out. If I were in the confidence of my
party .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Nowadays the unhappy accident of being a
peer .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Feeling that I should hear no more, I drifted to the
Turf and Stage, where Frank Jellaby thickened the mist
in which Crawleigh had enveloped the Carlton Club.
After a denunciation of the coalition-liberals which reminded
me of Cato’s punctual fulminations against Carthage,
he explained that the new crisis had been engineered
by ‘Blob’ Wister and that its outcome depended
on Wister’s success in finding a leader:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He had no difficulty in persuading people like Dean
and Lingfield to come out for an all-tory government
when his papers were marching ahead to cover their advance.
If he can get Bonar Law to stampede the meeting .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I hear Lingfield and the rest of George’s tory ministers
are swearing allegiance to him with one hand,” I
said, “and writing him letters of resignation with the
other.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>They</span> don’t know anything .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. except that some of
them will be badly left.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But no one,” I encouraged him, “will be left quite
so completely as your coalition-liberal friends.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jellaby’s face darkened:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They sold the pass in ’16, they’ve had their reward;
if there were another pass to sell, they’d sell it; and they
mustn’t complain if they can’t find one.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You won’t join forces,” I asked, “to keep the tories
out?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“After 1916 I could never trust a coaly-lib again,” he
answered. “Now, if your paper would help us into a
position where we could hold the balance .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That,” I said, “is simply overturning one coalition to
make way for another. And you’ve no more programme
to-day than you had in 1918, when you let Ll-G.’s mad
promises pass without a protest. We’re paying for your
silence to-day, at Chanak and wherever the French can
hit us.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Before Jellaby had time to answer, we were hurried
one stage farther along the ever unfinished road of contemporary
politics. Lord Saltash, whom I had observed
moving from table to table with the manner of a conspirator
rather far gone in wine, raised his eyebrows suddenly
as ‘Blob’ Wister hacked his way across the dancing-floor.
There was a quick nod; and Saltash lurched
towards the telephone-boxes, only pausing to whisper
thickly in my ear:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He’s going! Bonar, I mean. Meeting to-morrow.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Are you betting on the result?” I asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He’s not coming back politics sake being losing side,”
Saltash answered telegraphically, laying a squat index-finger
against one side of his nose. “Last kick dying
lion. Wash-out George. Number up.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jellaby was silent for a few minutes; then he smiled as
one who had waited patiently by the mills of the gods.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Had Zimri peace, who slew his master?,” he demanded
at large.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This is the end of the liberal party for a generation,”
I said; which was not the answer expected of me.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And then I stood up to say good-by. There is little
difference of age between Jellaby and myself; but he has
been nurtured more strictly on the official hatreds of a
whips’ office. I was born and bred a liberal, whereas
Jellaby embraced that faith as he embraced agnosticism,
the poetry of Arthur Hugh Clough, the painting of
Manet, the æsthetics of Pater and, for a time, total abstinence.
They were all fashionable among the members
of one coterie at Balliol in his day.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“For some years .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.” he conceded with regretful
solemnity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And,” I pursued, “what happens to liberalism, which
is more important to me than the liberal party?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jellaby had no answer ready; and, if he had not been
my host, I should have asked him whether a liberal
whips’ office cared for these things.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Next day the conservative wing of the coalition seceded,
after a brief debate, on the strength of a single, brief
speech. The prime minister resigned; and the king invited
Mr. Bonar Law to form a government. As soon as
the conservative party had accepted its new leader, the
date of the election was announced. Those of my
friends who were nursing constituencies became, of a
sudden, very important and excited; I received invitations
to speak from people who must have forgotten, if
they ever knew, how bad a speaker I am; wagers were
offered freely; and all parties predicted confidently that
they would return with increased numbers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I spent much time at the Eclectic Club in these days,
wondering what line my paper should follow in the election.
No new policy was being put forward; and, if the
old policy stood condemned, I did not understand why
ministers who were responsible for it were kept in office.
Nor, at a season when everybody speculated how long the
patience of the unemployed would endure, did I understand
why the order of the county was entrusted to a
man who had preached the sacred right of rebellion so
few years before in Ulster. I wondered, too, what would
happen to the floating wreckage of the coalition; and,
more bitterly than ever before, I missed old Bertrand’s
caustic humour in the hours when he sat with me here in a
window of the smoking-room, defaming the passers-by
and pretending that we were studying trends of opinion
and “the great movement of men”.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He it was who said that politics were desocialized
when Mr. Asquith left Downing Street. For six years
the political stage had been occupied by statesmen, demagogues,
shy scholars, blatant adventurers, advertising-agents,
unemployed millionaires, newspaper-proprietors,
dukes, international Jews and merchant-princes. Cabinet
control had been replaced by the personal domination of
one man who miraculously held this heterogeneous company
together; considered policy had yielded to a succession
of brilliant and incongruous improvisations. On
no day could an outsider foretell who next would pull a
wire; and, as I looked round the crowded rooms of the
Eclectic, I wondered what all these long-faced, out-of-work
pressmen and financiers, these confidential secretaries
and hangers-on would now do for a living or a
career.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then, as the ministry was completed and the first
election-addresses appeared, I recalled Bertrand’s last
verdict.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Without break of thought or mend of heart .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</span>”</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>Were</span> we going on from 1914? Had the war, in which
most of my generation perished, really achieved nothing?</p>

<h3>4</h3>

<p class='pindent'>As we slid noiselessly into the least passionate general
election of my experience, I wondered whether we were
going on from anything so good even as 1914. If the
German peril was at an end, no man could say what new
trouble might come out of the east, when demoralized
Russia and Austria joined hands with resentful Turkey
and Prussia. The mark had collapsed; and, unless it
could be rehabilitated, the trade of central Europe must
come to a standstill.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After that, it was a toss-up whether famine or revolution
came first. Against this tidal wave of hunger,
disease and the reckless savagery of hopeless millions,
the only powers with strength and means to build a rampart
were France, America and Great Britain.</p>

<p class='pindent'>If Lucien de Grammont and Clifford van Oss fairly
represented the first two, the simple faith of the French—embodied
in M. Clemenceau—was being betrayed by
every one else at the very moment when M. Clemenceau
was betraying the simple faith of President Wilson. Recalling
that the world was to have been made safe for
democracy, I wondered if another war must be fought
before democracy was made safe for the world. According
to one or other of us, it was the greed and bad faith
of Great Britain, America and France which was wholly
and solely responsible for our present perils.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In these days of misgiving the most persistent optimist
of my acquaintance was my father-in-law. To him—in
common with most of my conservative friends—public
life had been a bad dream from the moment when Sir
Henry Campbell-Bannerman and his <span class='it'>sansculottes</span> usurped
power. Crawleigh was genuinely convinced that all electors,
at all times and in all places, were conservative born
and bred; and, to him, a liberal victory could only come
by low cunning. Now that the spell had been broken,
he looked forward to “going on from 1906”; and, in
listening to him, I understood, as Saltash had never made
me understand, the all-conservative movement in the late
coalition, the Carlton Club meeting and the loathing of
the party for those who still tried to keep it in bondage
to its old associates. So a Bourbon might have felt
towards a legitimist who took office under Napoleon.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sir Roger Dainton, when I dined with him on the
night after the polling, was even more outspoken. Some
one had taught him the word “impeachment”; and he
was for impeaching the fallen members of the old cabinet
as light-heartedly as his wife, in other days, had consigned
“agitators” to the nearest firing-party.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You think there are further depths they can still
reach?,” I asked. The brush of a professional moralist
would be needed to paint the difference between this election
and the last, between the power of a prime minister
in being and that of the member for Carnarvon Boroughs.
“Come and see the results.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>By its rules the Eclectic Club is constituted a “place of
social intercourse for officers and gentlemen, irrespective
of politics”. Any demonstration, other than occasional
groans when a labour victory was announced, would have
been ill-received; but I was struck chiefly by the absence
of all desire to demonstrate except when objects of personal
venom appeared at the bottom of the poll. Dainton
thumped my back with furtive violence when two rich
and rather questionable private secretaries, from his own
party, were at last “put out of harm’s way”, as he expressed
it; and Jellaby became almost hysterical as one
coalition-liberal after another was edged into the cold;
but it was left to my father-in-law to express the rapture
of his associates in a series of satisfied grunts. Without
looking at the board, I could recognize a conservative
gain by Crawleigh’s long “A-a-ah!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The entry of the first French troops into their recovered
provinces,” I murmured to Jellaby.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And yet .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. they don’t seem as much pleased about
it as I should have expected.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Perhaps these fellows feel that it’s the same board,
the same problem, and that it becomes no easier by a
shuffle of the pieces. Perhaps they’re wondering what
more they can do than the coalition to prevent a world-revolution
or a new world-war.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jellaby looked contemptuously at the lengthening tale
of ministerial successes:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Perhaps they realize that these results don’t represent
the true strength of parties.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You mean it’s a moral victory for you?,” I asked.
“I said the same thing to you when I was beaten at Cranborne
in 1910. With respect I think the feeling of the
country is admirably represented in this club to-night:
nobody cares.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>With that I left him. Seven men, I think, said good-night
to me as I crossed the hall; six of them added:
“Well, thank God <span class='it'>that’s</span> over.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was a further spasm of excitement as the new
parliament met; and for me, though I was preoccupied
with Barbara’s return, a stab of regret when the liberal
party had to surrender its historic claim to lead the opposition.
Then one of the shortest sessions on record
opened and closed; the foreign secretary set out for
Lausanne to find an escape from the threatened war
in the near east; and the country gave its undivided
attention to the most popular murder-trial of the
year.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Save for a moment after Bertrand’s memorial service,
I had not been alone with Barbara since our scene in the
car. I fancied that she was hardly less embarrassed than
I was, though she talked easily enough of her plans for
being painted by Edmund Wace and of my work on
Bertrand’s papers. We both felt that nothing could be
quite the same after that explosion; but I at least had no
idea what she wanted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There was a touch of brutality about your uncle,”
she said after dinner the first night, in criticism of my
sketch. “I’m not sure that you bring it out. Any one
who disagreed with him was treated with such obvious
contempt.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Unless he happened to like the person,” I said. “I
can’t imagine a single point on which he agreed with you
or Violet or Amy, but he was devoted to you all. On the
other hand, I’ve heard him trouncing poor Sonia for
holding exactly the same views, simply because he thought
her second-rate.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He thought all women second-rate. So do you,
George,” she rejoined without malice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So sweeping a misstatement I could not allow to pass
unchallenged.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll leave you out for fear of embarrassing you
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.,” I began.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Barbara laughed sadly and turned, with a shrug, to
the fire:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, my dear, you’re leaving me out because you despise
me. Not <span class='it'>cruelly</span>, but just in the Oakleigh way:
as a tolerant Turk would despise me. In your eyes,
we’ve never grown up; and sometimes you shew us the
tenderness you’d shew to a child. You think we’re creatures
who’ve failed to be men; you don’t imagine that
we’ve never tried to be men.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. You smile benignly
on our little foibles and follies and frailties just as I
smile at a kitten chasing its own tail. ‘Kittens will be
kittens,’ I say; ‘women will be women,’ you murmur to
yourself.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The trouble is that you speak the same language
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But we don’t think the same thoughts. D’you remember
my telling you I’d forgotten certain things you’d
said?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>As her eyes turned slowly to meet mine, I thought I
could see a gentle new light of friendship.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wished at the time you’d said you had forgiven
them,” I answered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There was nothing to forgive. You were right, from
your point of view. May I speak of it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If it will help us.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Barbara turned once more to the fire and sat with her
cheek resting against her hand:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s just two years since Eric died. You think I’m
not in love with him and never was. Well, I’m not now,
but I was once; and the <span class='it'>whole</span> of my heart went into it,
George. Do men ever realize that women can be in
love with them and yet know all the time that it’s a
mistake? When he left me, Eric thought I’d been taking
all his love for my own selfish, greedy enjoyment. I
hadn’t. I took it because I couldn’t help myself; but I
always knew it would be a mistake for us to marry. We
were too much alike, too highly-strung. If you can
imagine two great musicians marrying .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. If only I’d
been strong enough to refuse his love! I couldn’t help
myself .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. It was wrong of me, by any standard, to
do what I did at Croxton. If I’d told you at the
time .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I should have thought nothing of it, I hope.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Barbara laughed mirthlessly and crossed to my chair,
where she seated herself on the arm.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s what I feared,” she whispered. “I knew I
was wrong, I knew it would have been hell for us all
if Eric had agreed, I’d had the worst rebuff that can
come to a woman, I was still in love with him. All that,
you’d have said, was nothing. A perfect Oakleighism!
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Yet I wish now I <span class='it'>had</span> told you. Eric’s letter
must have been a cruel shock.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her hand stole timidly to mine; and I raised it to my
lips:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s all over now; but, Babs, I did <span class='it'>not</span> spend twelve
days wondering whether you would run away with any
one else. What hurt was that you’d pretended to love
me when you didn’t.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And that’s what you’ve been urging me to do for
the last two years.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Silence fell between us. Then I said:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve been hoping that you could love me without
pretending. I forgot those twelve days the moment I
set eyes on you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes. You were as much in love with me as I was
with Eric. But love didn’t give you much understanding,
dear. For two years you’ve been waiting for me to confess
that I did something very wrong: you’d then be able
to commit another Oakleighism by forgiving me. You’ve
been waiting for me to say I’ve outgrown my love for
Eric, so that you could tell me—Oakleigh-fashion—that
you’d always known time would cure all things.
Well, I <span class='it'>was</span> wrong; and I <span class='it'>have</span> outgrown my love. Does
it help you to know that? The difficulty is, George, that
I don’t want to be forgiven. I’m not a child, I’m not an
unsuccessful attempt to be a man; I’m a woman.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And being a woman .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Barbara laid her hand over my lips:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Shall I say it for you? ‘Being a woman, you don’t
know what you <span class='it'>do</span> want.’ It’s quite true, even though
all the Oakleighs in history have said it. I know you so
much better than you know me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And better than you know yourself?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know myself better than I can explain myself.
Women feel so much more and express so much less than
men. Words are clumsy. When a man frames a sentence,
he imagines he is shewing a thought to the world;
a woman feels that the thought is being imprisoned, perhaps
mutilated.” .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you know why you married me?,” I asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Before she could answer, Barbara stared long at the
fire.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes. But I’ve never put it in words. I couldn’t now.
I wasn’t in love with you, but you gave me something
that I needed.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Women marry sometimes because
they’re frightened of themselves. Sonia did. And I remember
how my beloved aunts gloated over Jack Waring,
as the one man who could keep me in order. Strange
to say, I didn’t want to be kept in order; and I wasn’t
frightened of myself. I’m only frightened of death and
of waste: a wasted life, with all the love and the beauty
left out of it. You gave me the feeling that you had
something I needed to keep my life from being
wasted.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And do you feel that no longer?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Have I needed you these last two years? I’ve ceased
to look for happiness.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And you’re not yet thirty!,” I groaned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Barbara glanced at her watch and stood up:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s time for me to go to bed. I’m afraid I’ve talked
a great deal about myself. It was thinking about Bertrand
that started it. The world is divided into men,
women and Oakleighs.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I believe you’ll find, as you go on, that every husband
begins as a man and ends as an Oakleigh. That is
one of the major tragedies of life.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>For the first time in eighteen months, Barbara bent to
kiss my cheek.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To marry an Oakleigh and find him a man would be
the greatest romance life could offer,” she laughed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then I’m afraid you must look elsewhere for your
romance,” I sighed. “You can only give out what’s
in you. I’m sorry our marriage has been a failure. I’ve
honestly done my best.” .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Turning at the door, Barbara came slowly back and
kissed me again:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know you have. And I’ll do mine. I told you the
day poor old Bertrand died that I’d be your wife, I’d
bear you children if I could .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>In spite of her kisses, in spite of the strange new light
in her eyes, I had to be told in words that our two years’
tragedy was over:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My dear one, you said we should be dishonoured if
we put anything in the place of love .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I waited to hear that terrible verdict reversed. Barbara
looked at me in amazement and then gave a single
tearless sob. She regained her composure immediately
and walked again to the door.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You have a good memory, George,” she threw back.
“Have you saved that up for two years? Do you want
me to say that I’ve suddenly found you irresistible? The
Oakleighs are very true to their own type.”</p>

<h3>5</h3>

<p class='pindent'>As the door closed, I saw my last chance being shut
from me. The house was in darkness when I went into
the hall; there was no answer when I called to Barbara,
though I could see a light in her room. I came downstairs
again to brood of men, women and Oakleighs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I tried next day to explain, but Barbara refused with
cold courtesy to understand what I was trying to explain.
I had been patient, too patient; in her turn she was trying
to meet me. She was ready to give anything I asked, if
she had it to give; and the false sweetness of her complaisance
was a deadlier bar than any refusal.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I feel I was ungracious,” I said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ungracious? You?,” she mocked. “I must go now,
or I shall be late for Mr. Wace.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Shall I see you after the opening of parliament?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But of course! For another eternity! Good-bye.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The rest of that morning I spent in Fetter Lane, reviewing
the achievements of the peace-administration.
The only visible traces of the war, when I walked down
to Westminster, were the cenotaph in Whitehall and the
long army of unemployed that was trying to get past it
to the precincts of parliament. While I waited for the
crowd to disperse, I heard a familiar voice asking my
neighbour what was happening.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Raney! Here, you’d better let me see you home,”
I said. “There’s an appalling mob everywhere.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thanks, I’ve had to acquire a sixth sense,” he answered.
“What are you doing here?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Looking on and thinking of that week-end in August
when the Anti-Intervention people pursued me down to
Loring Castle. I’ve been wondering if we shouldn’t have
done better to keep out of the war at all costs.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We should have been dishonoured if we’d let Belgium
down,” he answered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If we’d told the Germans we would stop the moment
Belgium was evacuated, the war would have been over in
’14. And we shouldn’t have an unemployed army marching
through London to-day,” I added savagely.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We squeezed our way forward till a sudden thinning
of the crowd enabled us to escape into the park.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think we’re individually the better for the sacrifices
we all of us made,” he answered slowly. “For one moment
there was a real spirit of fraternity; and, when the
reaction has run its course, I hope to see that again. I’m
recruiting people now, with quite fair success: reminding
them what they did once and asking them to give up
everything for one month or six or a year for the service
of their country. I’m only asking them to do what I’ve
done myself. I tell them, as I tell you, <span class='it'>that’s</span> the new idea
that we must capture from the war. Fraternity .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Your new idea is at least as old as Christ and
Buddha,” I objected. “Will you succeed where they
failed?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Had they ever such a chance as we have? We’ve
seen the quality of modern war. We know that, if
there’s another, it will bury civilization under a sea of
lava. Men, women, sheep, cattle, the very blades of
grass. Another war is synonymous with the end of the
world.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But how does one set about being fraternal?,” I
asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>O’Rane walked for some distance without answering;
and I thought he had not heard my question. Then he
laughed and gave my arm a squeeze:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“By realizing the alternative, as every one’s had every
chance of doing in this war. By seeing that, if we
trample on people weaker than ourselves, there’ll be people
stronger than ourselves to trample on us. When I first
saw ‘fraternity’ shining in front of me like Constantine’s
Cross, I was a very small, very young, very miserable
boy. I went through hell till I learnt how to defend
myself. And then .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. many years afterwards .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I
began to think .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. about the poor devils who couldn’t
defend <span class='it'>themselves</span>. I saw that we must make a world in
which man wasn’t always measuring his strength. Yes, I
admit Christ had made the discovery before me,” he
ended with another laugh.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I forebore to ask whether the second discovery was
likely to change the hearts of men more than the first.
The rule of force, I pointed out, had to be repudiated by
every one at the same time:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If we’d been fraternal when the Germans were
marching on Calais .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If we’d been fraternal rather earlier, perhaps they’d
never have marched there. Some one has to make a
beginning. That’s one reason I had to give up this
money. Fraternity can’t exist side by side with vast
differences of wealth, among nations or individuals. It’s
our sense of possession, George, that stands between us
and our souls.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Unfortunately, ever since man appeared on this
planet, it’s been the instinct that keeps soul and body together.
Will you be the first to strip for the plunge?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>I’m</span> ready.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If you take that dive, Raney, your wife and children
won’t follow. They also are a part of humanity, which
I think you sometimes forget.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Who is my mother?’,” he murmured.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<h3>1</h3>

<p class='pindent'>Since the first tragedy cast its shadow on the first
man, philosophers have taught, in the jargon of their
choice, that the past is unalterable, that it is no use crying
over spilt milk and that it is a waste of time to job backwards.
Unphilosophic man has then returned to the
twilit dreamland of might-have-beens.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Daily, since the tragedy that darkened my life in the
last weeks of 1922, I have asked myself whether I could
have done anything to prevent it. I am sane enough to
realize that I contributed nothing by what I did; the
philosopher blandly assures me that questioning comes too
late; and, in spite of all, I continue to wonder what would
have happened if I had made a firm stand here or a
graceful surrender there. If only, as I walked with
O’Rane to The Sanctuary after the opening of parliament,
I had thrown my weight into one scale or the other .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
If only, at any time subsequently, I had shewn myself
to be what nature failed to make me, a man of action,
strong and silent, rapping out decisions like Napoleon
disposing an army .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<h3>2</h3>

<p class='pindent'>I had not intended to come into The Sanctuary, but
O’Rane insisted that Sonia would be disappointed if I
turned back at the door. We found her in the nursery,
playing with her elder boy, while the baby was packed
protesting to bed in the next room. I had not often been
privileged to catch Sonia in a domestic attitude and was
ill-prepared for her efficiency. This child in her lap was
a beautiful creature, in radiant health and exuberant
spirits, with his mother’s brown hair and eyes. There
was a lusty crow of delight when O’Rane came into the
room; and, as I shook hands with Sonia, the child demanded
shrilly that the interrupted tale of the day before
should be resumed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Will you say good-night to David junior?,” she
asked me, as Daniel surrendered to the spell of O’Rane’s
story.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If he’s not asleep,” I said; and she conducted me into
the presence of a wide-awake and fierce Japanese doll,
who gripped two of my fingers and demanded truculently
what I was doing in his nursery.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At three years old, the child had his father’s flashing
black eyes and imperious manner. Sonia added that he
had also more than his father’s indomitable obstinacy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is he equally fearless?,” I asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For answer she pointed from a green bruise on the
child’s forehead to a padlocked grille over the window:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“David had a fire-escape fitted the other day. He
went down it himself just to learn the way; and this infant
must needs follow. He’d never been on a ladder
in his life, but he climbed cheerfully out of the window
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Trusting to the special providence that looks after
all O’Ranes,” I put in.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“By the mercy of heaven a policeman caught him; but
if he behaves like that now .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He looks like keeping you fully occupied.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I can do what I like with him at present,” she answered,
“because he realizes I’m only a woman, and I
can get on the soft side of him. When he’s old enough
to see that women can be more easily bullied than men,
more easily hurt .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I don’t envy his wife. I don’t
envy any wife.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yet if all marriages were dissolved by act of parliament
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.,” I began, as she led me downstairs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Should I take David on again? I wonder! He’s
the only man I’ve ever loved.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. What fools we women
are! And what fools men are! They don’t want
a woman to have a will of her own; and, when she echoes
their will, they find her insipid. And what a fool I’ve
always been! Once I thought it would be wonderful
to run away .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. as I did. But that was only a wonderful
fit of bad temper,” she added with the candour that
she always employed in discussing herself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And one that you’ll never repeat.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No. In those days I was so hungry for children
that I thought myself quite immodest: if I’d had my first
one earlier, we should never have had our great tragedy.
Now that I’ve got two, you need never be afraid I shall
run away again even if David ties me to the bed and beats
me. I honestly, honestly don’t think of myself any longer
except through them. I want them to have the best
chance in life: all that you and Jim and my brothers
had. They must go to the best schools, the best universities;
they must never be driven down the wrong road
like so many boys because they haven’t the money to go
by the right one. They must be <span class='it'>secure</span>.” .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Her face
darkened; and she turned to the fire. “David won’t
promise me that. My father can’t afford it.” .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I believe that, if her husband could have seen Sonia
at that moment as I saw her, he would have compromised
with his insurgent conscience. Once before, when he
came back from France, I had seen her, as now, on her
knees; pleading, as now, for the privilege of serving him
and, as now, wholly forgetful of her too insistent self.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He’s not easy to move when he’s made up his mind,”
I said, with memories of our conversation earlier in the
afternoon.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sonia shook her head ruefully:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t I know that? You remember when that unemployment
deputation came to see him? We’ve had
about three a day ever since. Does that influence him?
The press camps on our doorstep. He’s besieged in his
office. This afternoon that man Griffiths came here
again.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What did you do with him?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her patience suddenly deserted her:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I sent him to Hampstead. This <span class='it'>is</span> a private house,
when all’s said and done. I don’t suppose he got any
satisfaction there, but I thought the walk would be good
for him. Odious little creature!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was now that I feel I might have done some good
by speaking strongly. Neither Griffiths nor any other
grown man deserved to be sent on a fool’s errand; in
cooler moments Sonia would have been ashamed to play
such a trick. Her answer, I suppose, would have been
that Griffiths and her husband were too much for any
one’s coolness; and I feared—no doubt, weakly—that I
should lose my slight influence over her if I sided with
her husband. When he came down from the nursery,
she was still indignant enough to retail Griffiths’ visit and
to ask O’Rane whether the deputation had reached Hampstead
in time to find him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I had to say I could do nothing for them,” he answered
a little wearily. “I’ve given all I can spare of
my own money; and I’ve collected as much as I can from
other people. If they come again, you might tell them
that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You must tell them yourself,” Sonia replied stiffly.
“<span class='it'>I’m</span> not going to make myself responsible.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I only wanted you to save them a useless journey.
When you sent them to me, you gave them some sort of
hope; and that makes it so much harder when I have to
turn them down.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Perhaps in time you’ll find it so hard .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.” she muttered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I can’t go back on what I’ve said. It’s only unkind
to give them a long walk for nothing. Promise me you
won’t do it again, Sonia.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let’s hope they won’t come again. If they do, I
shall <span class='it'>again</span> send them to you.” Then, without disguise,
her temper broke. “I’m not consulted about what you
do with this money, so I wash my hands of it. This is
not your office; and you can’t blame me if you refuse to
give them anything for their trouble.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I can only repeat that you make my task more difficult,”
O’Rane answered patiently.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Before I’ve done, I hope to make it impossible,”
Sonia retorted defiantly, as she hurried out of the library
and up the stairs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I had a second opportunity of speaking strongly, this
time to O’Rane; and I failed to press it. The papers
that night gave long accounts of the opening of parliament
and longer, less hackneyed descriptions of the demonstration
by the unemployed. I detected for the first
time a note of uneasiness as, for the first time, unemployment
passed out of the realm of abstract statistics and
incarnated itself in ragged armies of hungry men. I
remembered Philip Hornbeck’s blithe assurance that Griffiths
could do little harm so long as the armies were scattered;
well, their banners shewed that they were scattered
no longer. One nervous leader-writer compared this
march with the advance of the Marseillais on Paris and
asked angrily how the police had allowed it; another,
more valiant, rehearsed the history of the Fascismo movement
in Italy and warned the proletariat at large—without
considering whether the proletariat was likely to read
such a paper—that England would never yield to mob-violence.
A third, mentioning O’Rane by name, exhumed
the controversy of the summer and enquired whether
those who had voluntarily undertaken a national responsibility
could abandon it at such a time in satisfaction of
a “doctrinaire whim”. In less blunt terms than the
sandwichman had displayed, O’Rane’s ‘sentence of death’
was brought up against him; and it was with some muddled,
premonitory feeling of an isolated conflict between
Griffiths and the O’Ranes that I uttered my warning.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Suspend your sentence,” I said, “until the new government
has declared its unemployment policy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>O’Rane replied with the entirely logical and utterly
irrelevant thesis that unemployment was a consequence
of the war, that the community had called the tune and
must pay the piper, that one government had imposed
conscription of men’s lives and that another could impose
conscription of their wealth. The state had turned prosperous
civilians into soldiers; the state must turn these
soldiers back into prosperous civilians.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His cold reasoning and neat phrasing reminded me
of a speech at some undergraduate debating-society.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I can only hope,” I said, “that you won’t have to
say ‘no’ again.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hungry men had no time for debating-society arguments.
I hoped, too, that Sonia would not be forced to
say ‘no’ again. Hungry men had no taste for being
ordered to walk from Westminster to Hampstead as a
move in the game with her husband. I said no more.
And, amid my self-reproaches, I find a barren comfort
in the knowledge that neither Sonia nor her husband
would have listened, though one rose from the dead to
warn them.</p>

<h3>3</h3>

<p class='pindent'>Thereafter, like every one else, I waited to see the
policy of the government proclaimed. The debate on
the address gave rise to some acrimonious passages between
the two front benches; a programme of rather remote
public-relief work was fluttered in the face of the
labour party; and the prime minister ostentatiously reestablished
departmental responsibility and dissociated
himself from the improvisations of his predecessor by
refusing to receive a deputation of the unemployed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then the interest of the public sought a new stimulus.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I am inclined to think that modern journalism, with
its craving for daily excitement and its acquiescence in
the superficial, has incapacitated us for patient study.
Few subjects unconnected with sex or bloodshed can hold
the attention of a newspaper-reader for more than three
days; and, when the men with schemes for employment
had been photographed as they walked to Downing Street
and when a popular novelist had protested passionately
that the unemployed were not really bolshevists, the eyes
of the nation were allured by pictures of Lord Curzon
entering his train for the Lausanne conference, and
controversialists with uncertain memories enquired
rhetorically the name of the last woman to be hanged
in England for complicity in murder. Like the peace
negotiations, like the war, like the domestic and international
unrest before the war, like the Irish problem,
this unemployment business became a bore: the public
was accustomed to the variety of a “continuous performance”
in its cinematograph theatres, it expected a “new
programme weekly” for its political stage.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I myself was compelled for professional reasons to
study problems of public policy even after they had
ceased to be fashionable. The only excuse for continuing
our paper was to be found in my uncle’s warning that,
after four years of peace, we were in at least no better
position than at the outbreak of war; at his death, we had
cut our last party-ties and were standing behind the
government as friendly critic. If the new administration
shewed no improvement on the old, we should have to
consider—as I told my colleagues—whether we were
to throw in our lot with labour, whether we should lay
our paper in its overdue grave or whether we must extend
to our own country the verdict of revolutionary Russia
that the old machine of national and international
government had broken down.</p>

<p class='pindent'>That verdict was pronounced in my private hearing
by Griffiths himself, with a warning that he would repeat
it publicly if the government failed to give him instant
satisfaction. Our second interview was no more
of my seeking than the first. When the House rose without
curing unemployment then and there, he made it
known—first of all at a mass-meeting in Trafalgar
Square and then in handbills which were distributed about
the streets—that he would instruct ministers in the meaning
of unemployment by confronting them with the unemployed.
This, in the vague phrase which he favoured,
would “put things to the test”. The demonstrations at
the opening of parliament had been hardly more than a
parade. “Hunger marches” were now to be organized
in every part of the country, converging on London at
the same moment. After that .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.? I noticed that
Griffiths carefully refrained from saying what would
happen when fifty, or a hundred, thousand disappointed
men found themselves empty-handed, empty-bellied, foot-sore
and resentful at the closed door of an impotent office.
And I pointed out this sinister omission in the next number
of <span class='it'>Peace</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was nothing, Hornbeck told me at this time, in
the speech or the manifesto to justify police interference;
but any one who remembered Griffiths’ share in organizing
the land-grabbing campaign could imagine how this
new demonstration would be conducted and how it was
likely to end. I went farther than most of my <span class='it'>confrères</span>
and denounced the manifesto as deliberately provocative.
Griffiths called to inform me that, if I chose to print lies,
he could not stop me, but that, if I was interested in the
truth, I might perhaps be not too proud to hear it from
him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I professed a prompt eagerness for truth in any form,
though I was more interested to know what amusement
or instruction he derived from so painfully academic a
journal as <span class='it'>Peace</span>. I wondered how he came to associate
me with its direction and why he visited me in Seymour
Street rather than in Fetter Lane. My curiosity on this
last point was satisfied when he ran a practised eye over
the dimensions of the house and asked me how many
the establishment comprised.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You? And your wife? And six servants?,” he
recapitulated. “No kids? A car and a man to drive it?
Four meals a day? You don’t call <span class='it'>that</span> provocative?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If we had fewer servants, you’d have more unemployed,”
I pointed out.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It takes three men and four women to keep the two
of you alive. The house is half empty. You waste more
food in a day than my people eat in a week. You drive
about in your jewels and fine clothes among people who’ve
been cold and hungry for months. And then you tell me
not to be .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. ‘provocative’!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I reminded him that we were supposed to be discussing
unemployment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I shan’t remedy that by going about in rags,” I said,
“or by shutting up half the house.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If you were in Germany, you wouldn’t be allowed to
have empty rooms. And, if you were in Russia, you
wouldn’t be allowed twenty coats when the next man has
nothing but a shirt between him and the rain.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I reminded him that we were in England and that he
had called to demonstrate how little provocation his
manifesto contained.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If the government orders me to find accommodation
for people without homes,” I said, “if I have to clothe
them and feed them, I’ll do it to the best of my ability.
I put obedience to the law above all things.” The little
red eyes glowed in anticipation of an attack. “My criticism
of you is the criticism I’ve brought before now
against the people who preach a general strike for political
objects. That’s not the way to proceed in a constitutional
country. There’s no end to it short of revolution.
You object to the word ‘provocative’.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Did you <span class='it'>read</span> what I said?,” he interrupted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Every word. It was admirably phrased. A single
letter more would have had you prosecuted. You’re careful
not to provoke anybody in words; but I tell you that
you’re inciting people to violence by your actions. You
know their temper far better than I do. You know what
you’ve taught them to regard as the minimum standard
of housing, feeding, wages and out-of-work pay. Do
you believe you’ll get it by bringing a hundred thousand
men to London?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Griffiths hesitated perceptibly. If he said “no”, he
condemned himself for inflating his followers with false
hopes; if he said “yes”, he was confessing himself the
prophet of intimidation in its crudest form.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In time,” he answered at length.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do your men realize that they’ll have to wait?” He
hesitated again for fear of admitting that he had taught
them too well or not well enough. “No government in
the world can submit to the dictation of a mass-meeting.
You know that. If it surrendered to-morrow, you’d
have another mass-meeting the day after. I think you
know that too.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And still they wouldn’t have all they’re entitled to,”
he murmured.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s another question. My charge is that you’re
bringing thousands of men to London on false pretences.
They’re probably not in the sweetest of moods; and small
blame to them. They won’t get what you’re promising
them; and they’ll turn on you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The red eyes flashed defiantly:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I can look after myself.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>So far, we had kept fairly free from personal attacks,
but something in Griffiths’ manner or voice exasperated
me. I had not admitted him in order to be lectured about
the number of servants who were needed to keep me alive;
the angry, ferret’s eyes gave me a curious feeling that I
must bite before I was bitten; and, seeing him—perhaps
quite unjustifiably as a vindictive, treacherous little animal,
I fixed a quality of untrustworthiness on the man.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You will look after yourself,” I prophesied, “by putting
the blame on the government and rousing your people
against law and order instead of telling them there
was never a hope of their getting any of the things you
promised.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Though my antagonist betrayed his feelings in an angry
flush, he affected to dismiss my prediction as something
unworthy of his notice:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They said that at Woolhampton,” he answered,
“when we seized the Town Hall. I’m always stirring
people up, it seems .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Provocative .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. because I
put the blame where the blame should go! You haven’t
called me a paid agitator yet.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve no intention of doing so. I say to your face, as
I said in print, that you’re provoking something which
may end in a revolution. I take the purity of your motives
for granted. You’ve volunteered to tell me the
truth and to shew that you’re not organizing constructive
revolution.” .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Despite the dislike which I could not help feeling, there
was no doubting the man’s passionate sincerity. He felt
for the people he championed the same frenzied protectiveness
and lust for revenge that I should have felt if
my sister had been hacked to pieces before my eyes. Argument
was out of the question; warnings were idle. I
reconsidered the phrase I had used in likening him to a
spiteful ferret, for he was touched with the greatness
that is inseparable from fanaticism. Self-advancement
and self-advertising had no place in his thoughts, though
he was arrogantly confident of his authority as a popular
leader and of his power to cut knots that had baffled every
other hand. In a conversation that extended over two
hours I learned nothing of his private history; at the
end I realized no better than at the beginning why he had
singled me out for his aggressive apologia. The resonant
blows of our blunt swords echoed emptily on our impenetrable
harness; and, when I saw him to the door, I
was saying for the fiftieth time: “You’re trying to stir
up a revolution”; and for the fiftieth time he was retorting:
“If your precious government can’t do anything,
some one else had better have a try.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>As we crossed swords for the last time, Barbara drove
up to the door. She had been giving another sitting to
Wace; and her appearance, in an ermine coat and a diamond
star, was not wasted on Griffiths, who bowed ironically
and looked her up and down as though he were
assessing her in terms of daily meat-meals.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, I must be off,” he said; and I know he was recapitulating
again: “<span class='it'>You. And your wife. And six
servants .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</span>”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m glad to have had this talk,” I said, “even though
we’ve not convinced each other. If you think I’ve misrepresented
you, I can only offer you equal space in our
columns to put yourself right with our readers.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I shan’t have time,” he answered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You can do it in two lines. If you’ll answer my
charge that you’re working, consciously or unconsciously,
for a revolution .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m answering it now,” he interrupted. “From here
I go to King’s Cross and from King’s Cross to the north.
Putting things to the test. I shall be back again in just
the time that it takes us to walk here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>As he disappeared from sight, Barbara commented admiringly
on his exit:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“For a third curtain, it was unsurpassed. I <span class='it'>do</span> want
to know what’s going to happen in the last act.”</p>

<h3>4</h3>

<p class='pindent'>If I did not know then, I had a strength of conviction
that amounted almost to knowledge. There was going to
be public excitement; there was going to be loose speaking;
there was going to be bad blood. And, after that,
there might well be rioting.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I have replayed the game a hundred times since that
day and asked myself what I could have done to change
the issue. Before the war I should have talked to Bertrand;
and, if he had shared my apprehensions, he would
have spoken a word to the responsible ministers. With
this new government of men unknown to me, with this
new House no longer even in session, there was no one I
could approach. During the war, when we broke down
most of the interdepartmental walls, a telephone message
from the Admiralty would have stirred sympathetic
chords in Scotland Yard or the Home Office. Now I
had long severed my connection with the public service;
Philip Hornbeck was my one remaining link; and, if I
bothered him again, I ran the risk of being told that Griffiths
was become a bee in my bonnet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This notwithstanding, I did ask Barbara to arrange a
dinner; and I am only sorry that I did not make the invitation
more urgent.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is anything the matter?,” she asked in some surprise,
for Hornbeck had dined with us only two or three nights
before.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not at the moment; but there may be trouble if some
one doesn’t spike that fellow Griffiths’ guns. In his way,
the man’s right: as the government <span class='it'>has</span> no remedy, you
can’t find an answer to people who say they’ll take the
remedy into their own hands. But the common sense of
the world won’t allow that. Griffiths will be refused a
hearing; the mob may break a few windows; and then the
police will clear the streets. It’s not worth marching an
army three hundred miles to learn that old lesson.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Until they’ve learnt it, they’ll go on believing in men
like Griffiths,” said Barbara.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But it will be a more costly lesson than they realize.
With the best intentions in the world, he’s marching them
into a trap. I want Hornbeck to stop the march and
break up the units before they can collect in force.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>We telephoned to the Admiralty; but Hornbeck had
left. When I got in touch with him next day, he was
engaged for several nights ahead. Rather shamefacedly,
I told him my fears; and he promised to enquire what
steps were being taken, though I felt I had wholly failed
to communicate my dread of the wasted little fanatic
Griffiths. In the middle of the following week I read that
the great “hunger-march” had begun; and, when Hornbeck
dined with us, he explained that Griffiths was being
given enough rope to hang himself, but no more. One
army had reached Nottingham, a second was on the outskirts
of Coventry and a third was halting on the east
side of Newbury; but they would not be allowed to reach
London. Since my interview with him, the leader and
spokesman had abandoned his former caution; and Hornbeck
told me that the police were waiting to prosecute
him for inciting to crime.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s a pity to wait,” I said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What else can one do?,” asked Hornbeck.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Perhaps my memory is biased by the events of the
following week, perhaps my instinct was right in warning
me that Griffiths was one of the most dangerous firebrands
that I had ever met. He haunted me, as the
shadow of Marat must have haunted the well-to-do citizens
of Paris; and I felt an equal, unreasoning impatience
with the departments that ignored him and with the papers
that advertised him. For two or three days the great
march was reported mile by mile, with a list of the victories
won by “Griffiths’ armies” over the powerless
custodians of such county halls, municipal libraries and
public baths as they occupied on their way. For the same
period the government maintained a calm and dignified
silence. Then new interests demanded attention and
space.</p>

<p class='pindent'>By the time that the various units joined forces in the
open country beyond Neasden, hunger-marching commanded
no price in the ever-changing tariff of news-items.
London was shopping for Christmas; the Lausanne conference
was becoming every day more firm and ineffectual;
Signor Mussolini was in England; Germany had
defaulted again; and the prime ministers of the late allies
were discussing with their financial experts new and final
methods of settling the problem of reparations.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I only learned that the army was at hand when I read
that the government policy for combating unemployment
had been fully explained and that, in the opinion of one
private secretary, “<span class='it'>no useful purpose would be served by
a meeting between the Minister and the leaders of the unemployed
now collected in Wembley Park</span>.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This is the moment I’ve been dreading,” I told Barbara.
“Griffiths has made fools of these people; and
he can only recover his authority by fighting the government.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I read next day that the leaders of the unemployed insisted
upon sending a deputation to the minister of labour.
A public demonstration was announced later; and
from an evening paper I learned that, while the police
would not interfere with an orderly march through the
streets, it must not be conducted in the neighbourhood
of Westminster. As I walked home that night, I was
given a handbill in which I read, over the signature of
Griffiths, that the hunger-march would be resumed next
morning and would be directed first to Buckingham
Palace, then—as a concession to constitutionalism—to
the Home Office and finally—for a reason I could not
guess, since parliament was no longer sitting—to the
House of Commons. It was not for Scotland Yard to
say who might or might not have access to the king or
his responsible ministers; and the problem that chiefly
vexed the spirit of Griffiths was to discover who in fact
was responsible.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now,” I told my colleagues when I reached Fetter
Lane through a double line of police, “there’s going to
be trouble. The only thing that can stop it will be a
downpour of rain.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And there is in fact a hard frost,” yawned Triskett.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This fog may do as well,” said Jefferson Wright.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s pretty serious,” we all agreed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Did any of us believe in the warnings and predictions
which we uttered? I cannot say. Everything that happened
in these days is coloured by the memory of what
happened afterwards. I may conceivably take credit for
explaining before other people that these demonstrations
were on a different plane from the coal strikes and railway
strikes that aroused our uneasiness after the war;
on the other hand, I may only have been suffering from
disordered nerves. It was the end of the year; I wanted a
holiday; and the self-control which I had to exercise at
home sometimes deserted me when I was at my office.
Accordingly I claim no praise and feel no shame in saying
that I was nervous. The long lines of police-pickets
had not been stationed about the streets without some
purpose; and the news that trickled in throughout the
morning was not of a kind to allay anxiety.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Philip Hornbeck did indeed repeat by telephone his
customary assurance that Griffiths could be discounted.
When the marchers entered Regent’s Park, they were
warned that they would not be allowed to approach Downing
Street; and, as Hornbeck walked to the Admiralty,
he passed half-a-dozen columns of dejected, leaderless
men who were standing easy or trudging slowly under
banners of ineffectual protest. Even the bands, he said,
were dispirited. After one glance, the passers-by paid
no heed to a sight that was now wearisomely familiar;
and, in Hornbeck’s eyes, the gaunt, ragged army found
its best friends among the constables who tramped in
a protective and restraining cordon.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Did these fellows seem disappointed?,” I asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think they were too tired, poor devils, to feel anything.
If it hadn’t been for the bobbies, you might have
thought it was another retreat from Moscow. I believe
there <span class='it'>was</span> some plain speaking when they found their
Napoleon had left them, but I hear he’s only gone to see
about billets. The police are helping him all they can.
That’s the way we stop revolutions in England,” he
chuckled.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I was reminded again of the day now long distant
when O’Rane and I had stood in a crowd of many thousands
to watch the body of Terence McSwiney drawing
through the respectfully silent streets of London. The
English, I felt, behaved sometimes like characters in a
comic opera: consistent only in their inconsistency, they
could not rise to a revolution. With a longer leap into
the past, my memory fastened on a moment in O’Rane’s
first year at Melton, when he watched a half-hearted attempt
at a May Day demonstration and, in disgust at
the apathy of the demonstrators, instructed them in the
Marseillaise. I wondered if he recalled that day, which
was also nearly his last as a scholar of Melton. I wondered
if he and Hornbeck were right in discounting this
threat of revolution.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then I thought of the weary crowds that were pouring
into London.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If you’d put a spoke in his wheel at the beginning
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.,” I began.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You can’t stop peaceful pedestrians from walking
along the king’s highway,” Hornbeck rejoined, “and
Griffiths arranged that the armies should only <span class='it'>become</span>
armies when they were too big to turn back.”</p>

<h3>5</h3>

<p class='pindent'>I had intended to lunch at the Eclectic in the hopes of
hearing what steps the government was taking to house
and feed the hunger-marchers, but, when I was halfway
to St. James’ Street, I turned north and walked home
with a vague feeling that I must see how Barbara was getting
on.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When Spence-Atkins asked me point-blank if I thought
there would be any outbreak, I had replied with conviction
that I did not. That, however, was in the office;
and, as I walked west, I was disquieted by the sight of
these silent columns, marching aimlessly, halting and
dissolving into little knots of stragglers too weary to
march longer. In Waterloo Place and Regent Street,
the police imposed an order which the men themselves
had been unable to maintain; but from Hanover Square
to Park Lane the army split into its elements. Through
the settling fog I saw men sitting on the kerbs and clustering
on the island-refuges; they dropped in a shapeless
heap on the first convenient doorstep; and the good-humoured
constables who said “Now then, you must
move along” found themselves addressing ears that were
already deaf with sleep.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Half of them are no more than boys, sir,” one policeman
pointed out to me. “Tired out, that’s what they
are. They don’t mean no harm.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>By a damnable irony, the men had chosen for their collapse
a moment when Brook Street offered a tantalizing
blend of warm, savoury smells. I, who had never known
the meaning of hunger, found my appetite quickening.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They’re tired out and <span class='it'>hungry</span>,” I said. So far as I
am a judge of accents, some of these boys had come from
the Black Country, others from Lancashire, others again
from Northumberland. “I live near here. Is it any good
trying to raise some soup .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The constable shrugged his shoulders and waited while
an old man, who had fainted, was lifted on to an ambulance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If once you begin, sir, you’ll have the whole lot of
them at your door. It’s more than one man can tackle.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I walked on to Seymour Street with a growing sense
of despair. All this had been prophesied to Griffiths in
forcible language ten days before; but my meagre powers
of imagination and description never came within miles
of actuality. I had not realized the dishonour to humanity
which a man commits when he no longer hides a
broken spirit; I had forgotten the disfigurements of starvation
and the sickly stench of neglect. The policeman
was entirely right: half these fellows were only boys;
and I felt the blood mounting to my head when I thought
of the way they were victimized and their ignorance
exploited. During the war I had seen them and their
elder brothers trotting obediently to the slaughter-house
and bemusedly offering their lives for a cause that was
never explained and for objects that they never understood.
Now, no less obediently, they trotted in answer
to a voice that promised them a quick millennium.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I should have caught some hope, for all my denunciation
of violence, if they had torn Griffiths limb from
limb; but the patient credulity that collected them under
his leadership accepted uncomplainingly the fate to which
he led them. Griffiths, as he had boasted to me, could
look after himself; providence, the police or the devil
might look after his followers, who sprawled about the
misty streets like slumbering cattle.</p>

<p class='pindent'>If I had expected to find Barbara sharing my own
anxiety, I might have known better than to expect any
sign of it. She greeted me with faint surprise because I
had not warned her that I should be lunching at home;
then the surprise turned to relief as she recollected that
she was a man short.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s a family party,” she explained. “Father and
mother and Charles. I asked the O’Ranes; but David
can’t get away, so you must take his place.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. You’re
not ill or anything are you, George?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, no, thanks. <span class='it'>Depressed</span>, if you like. London’s
a horrible sight with all these hunger-marchers dropping
down on every side from sheer exhaustion. I don’t
know what’s to be done about them. I only hope there
won’t be a scrap.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Barbara looked out of window; but the fog was now
so thick that she could not see across the street.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Was that why you came back?,” she asked with her
head averted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wanted to see that you were all right.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thank you.” .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. As though afraid that I might
take advantage of her curt gratitude, she broke into a
laugh. “Some one—I think it was Jim—once said
that, when the revolution came, there’d be keen competition
between Sonia and me for a place in the first tumbril.
If it begins to-day, we shall be able to drive down together.
I suppose we <span class='it'>are</span> two of the most useless human
beings in creation.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I hope the mob doesn’t break
in while father’s here: I know he’d struggle with the
executioner, and I think it’s unfair to hinder a man who’s
simply trying to do his duty.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I feel Robson would probably save us,” I answered.
“He’d tell the mob, very patiently, that it was out of the
question for them to have a revolution in Seymour
Street.” .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You don’t really expect any trouble, do you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>As I believed Barbara to be entirely fearless, I did not
mind speaking frankly:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It all turns on what’s likely to happen in the next
few hours. The men are too tired at present even to feel
hungry. When they wake up, they’ll be like ravening
wolves.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>On Crawleigh’s arrival, I was distantly comforted to
find that he shared my own view and had indeed spent an
hour trying to get it accepted in Downing Street. During
his viceroyalty he had been ultimately responsible for
the relief-works in two famines; and, for once, I found
him pregnant with constructive proposals. Three or four
of the biggest catering-firms, he urged, should set up
kitchens in the London parks; every public hall should be
turned into a dormitory; and, if supplies ran short in the
shops, there must be a house-to-house visitation to collect
bread and blankets.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’d punish the ring-leaders without mercy,” he added,
“but we must do one thing at a time. This is December,
these men are starving; and for the next forty-eight hours
we must simply suspend our ordinary laws. Why the
government ever <span class='it'>allowed</span> such madness .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>We were still discussing emergency measures when
Sonia came in very late and apologetic. Every approach
to Westminster, she reported, was barred with lines of
mounted police; St. James’ Park was closed, Whitehall
and Victoria Street were barricaded. She herself had
crossed the river at Lambeth and come by tube from
Waterloo.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Are things still quiet?,” Lady Crawleigh enquired
nervously.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I should think so; but the fog’s so thick that you
can’t tell.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Did David find you?,” Sonia asked me.
“He wanted to talk to you about soup-kitchens or something.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He hadn’t come when I left the office,” I answered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As we went in to luncheon, Charles Neave, who had
come up from the country the day before, contributed
some first-hand observations on the march from Cumberland.
It had been peaceful and orderly from the moment
when the marchers convinced their potential antagonists
that they meant to have what they wanted. Private property
was scrupulously respected; but, on the principle that
churches and public buildings belonged to the community,
Griffiths’ ‘armies’ took possession of them as lodgings
for a night. I was given to understand that there had
been one or two sharp conflicts; but Crawleigh was expressing
more than his own opinion when he reminded
us that this was December and that the men were starving.
Barns and warehouses were offered voluntarily as
soon as their owners were satisfied that they would not
be damaged.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How did they manage for food?,” I asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The workhouse people did what they could. I think
the rest was voted by the different town-councils. There
wasn’t enough to go round anywhere, but a whole lot was
given privately.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Were there any speeches or demonstrations?,” asked
Crawleigh.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I didn’t hear any. Everybody seemed to be on the
side of the marchers. They felt it was jolly hard lines
and something ought to be done. Any ass who calls it
bolshevism doesn’t know what he’s talking about.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If we can only get them back as quietly as they’ve
come .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.” Crawleigh began and left his sentence unfinished.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I wondered whether he too was reflecting that the most
dangerous revolution is the one in which popular sympathy
goes out to the revolutionaries. In the last years
of the eighteenth century the history of the world would
have been changed if Louis had not forbidden the Swiss
Guard to fire from the windows of the Tuileries; it was
in fact changed—and revolution died in giving birth
to Bonapartism—when Napoleon cleared the streets of
Paris with a whiff of grapeshot. I would more readily
have turned a machine-gun on my own dining-room than
have harassed the spent men whom I saw collapsing on
the doorsteps of Brook Street; but I wondered how far
the sympathy of the onlookers and the kindliness of the
police would paralyse vigorous action if the spent men
rose and had to be coerced.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is anybody in <span class='it'>fact</span> taking any steps?,” I asked Crawleigh.
“We’ve food in the house, we can buy
more.” .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They’re collecting food and money as it is,” added
Sonia. “Just before I came here, that little red-eyed
Welshman called to see David .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“D’you mean Griffiths?,” I asked in surprise.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes. That’s another reason why I was so late. He
wouldn’t go. I told him I’d nothing to give him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Did he come alone?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, no! There was a queue stretching farther than
I could see. He told me he was sure Mr. O’Rane wouldn’t
refuse to help when he realized what these men had been
through to bring their grievances before the government.”
Sonia’s expression grew suddenly hard. “I told
him we weren’t the government; and I should be very
glad if he’d take his army to Hampstead and let me get
to my taxi.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Before I had time to warn her against such trifling,
I was called to the telephone and informed that O’Rane
himself was in Fetter Lane and wished to see me at
once.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hullo? This is a private wire, isn’t it?,” he began.
“Good! I came to see you on quite other business. Then
one of your people came in with the latest news, and
I felt I should have to borrow your eyes for the
afternoon. I’m afraid Griffiths’ people are getting out
of hand. There’s a certain amount of damage being
done .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Whereabouts?,” I interrupted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In Hampstead. I’ve warned the police; and, of
course, Hampstead is a big place; but I couldn’t help wondering
if they’d taken it into their heads to loot my office.
I’m afraid they won’t find more than about five pounds
in the till; but there are a lot of young clerks there, and
I don’t want them to have a scare. If you could pick
me up here and come to inspect the field of battle .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll be with you as soon as I can get across London,”
I answered.</p>

<h3>6</h3>

<p class='pindent'>As I hung up the receiver, I saw Barbara standing in
the doorway. One hand gripped the moulding of the
frame; the other was pressed to her side. I jumped up
in sudden alarm and helped her to a chair, for her lips
were moving without giving forth any sound.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Babs! Darling heart, what’s the matter?,” I asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s what I came to find out,” she answered with
an effort that almost choked her. “George, you’re not
going!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not till you’re all right,” I promised. “Are you
feeling faint? I shall have to go out for a bit: a man
who’s waiting to see me at the office .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But you’re not going!,” she repeated frantically.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’ll only be for an hour or so .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’ll be for all eternity! George, if you go, you won’t
come back! Can’t you <span class='it'>feel</span> it? I know when death’s at
hand! Have I ever been wrong? Uncle Bertrand.
Eric .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Oh, before the war! Jack Summertown and
the other boys in Jim’s last party! I know, I <span class='it'>know</span>! You
think I’m mad .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But, my dear, who’s going to kill me?,” I asked.
“I’ve been in too many London fogs to fear them much;
and, if you’re thinking of the hunger-marchers, I’m afraid
the poor devils couldn’t do any mischief even if they
wanted to. I made an appointment with a man .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“With David. You put him before me?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I was at a loss to think of anything that would calm
her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He is my best and oldest friend,” I said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You always <span class='it'>have</span> put him before me,” she cried.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My dear, you speak as if you were jealous! It’s absurd
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I heard what you said to him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then you couldn’t have heard more than about six
words. I said I’d be with him .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And wasn’t that enough? Wasn’t it enough when I
knew he wanted you? I’m not jealous; I’m terrified!
Don’t I know what he said to you? He’s in trouble
and he wants to drag you into it. But he shan’t, he
shan’t!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I sat down by Barbara’s side and told her, so far as I
could remember, word for word all that O’Rane had said
to me.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You know what Fleet Street rumours are,” I ended,
though I felt it was unfortunate that this rumour of rioting
in Hampstead had followed so disquieting soon on
Sonia’s jaunty account of her meeting with Griffiths.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If there weren’t danger, you wouldn’t think it necessary
to go. It’s no good lying to me, George. I’ve lived
with you too long not to know something about you. I
ask you to stay.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If Raney could see for himself .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.,” I began.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let some one <span class='it'>else</span> go!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Though I could not tell Barbara, I remembered vividly
the night when I had sat alone in that room, begging
O’Rane to come and keep me company. I remembered,
too, his characteristic promise that he would see me
through to the grave and beyond.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He’s never asked me to do anything for him before.
I’ve promised; and I’m afraid I can’t go back on it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Barbara stood up as though she were going to rejoin
her guests. Physically she was in control of herself and
could walk without difficulty or apparent pain; mentally
she seemed to be on the verge of a collapse.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Four and a half,” she muttered at the door.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Four and a half what?,” I asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Four and a half years since <span class='it'>you</span> made certain promises
to <span class='it'>me</span>. Four and a half years since we were married.
David has only to raise his little finger .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This is hardly the time to hold a <span class='it'>post mortem</span> on our
marriage,” I said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And I’m hardly the person?,” she taunted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I didn’t say that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You wouldn’t! You made up your mind to be patient
with me at all costs. You just <span class='it'>wouldn’t</span> lose your
temper! Dear God, why didn’t you, George? I deserved
it. We could have been friends if you’d dropped your
hateful superiority for a moment, if you’d ever become
human! You <span class='it'>can</span> be! You were marvellously sympathetic
when all was going well; but, after the crash, you
behaved like a stone god. I was wrong. I <span class='it'>told</span> you I
was wrong. You didn’t blame me. You know I’m
jealous through and through, but you wouldn’t punish
me by falling in love with some one else. You didn’t
even complain of this ghastly two years’ imprisonment.
Won’t you ever meet me half way? I told you my love
for Eric was dead; you know I never loved any one else.
What more do you want? Must I apologize? I will!
I’m sorry. I love you, I need you! I wouldn’t say it the
other night, because I was trying to hold together the
rags of my pride. Isn’t that enough? If you’ll stay, I’ll
make up for all my wickedness and cruelty. You’re all
I have in the world. I didn’t know it before; but now
I can feel death hovering over you like some great black
bird. If you go .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. If you go .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Suddenly turning, she clung to me, laughing and crying.
I stood without speaking because her intensity of
feeling overwhelmed me. I remember stroking her
hands. I believe I told her that I should be back before
she had time to miss me.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But you’re not going <span class='it'>now</span>?,” she cried.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Darling, I must. I shan’t be in any more danger
than I am now; but, if it were a question of bombs and
machine-guns, you wouldn’t ask me to let Raney down.
He wouldn’t have asked me if he didn’t need me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Barbara’s hands disengaged themselves from mine and
rose to draw me into her embrace. As our lips met, I
felt that she belonged to me, at last, heart and soul; but,
when I looked into her eyes, I read her frantic certainty
that we should never kiss again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m coming back, sweetheart,” I promised her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good-bye,” she whispered. Then, still gripping my
shoulders, she looked wildly about the room as though to
face and drive away this black presence of death that was
haunting her. “It’s .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. come too late. Good-bye .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
and forgive me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m coming back,” I told her again; but Barbara was
now kneeling with eyes closed and folded hands.</p>

<p class='pindent'>If she heard me, she made no sign; I fancy she heard
nothing but her own passionate prayers. As I stumbled
into the choking fog, the door slammed behind me; and
for the first time in these bewildering five minutes I
realized that I was awake.</p>

<h3>1</h3>

<p class='pindent'>In Seymour Street I could not distinguish the houses
on the far side of the road; at the Marble Arch I was
unable to see from the one side of the pavement to the
other; and I made my cautious way to the tube station
chiefly by sense of touch.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A London fog can be the completest insulator in the
world. Paralysing sight and muffling sound, it separates
the individual from his fellows in the densest part of a
crowded street. As I walked up Great Cumberland
Place, there was no sound but my own faint footsteps;
the whole city belonged to me.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘<span class='it'>Dear God, the very houses seem asleep</span>’;” I murmured
involuntarily:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘<span class='it'>And all that mighty heart is lying still.</span>’ ”</p>

<p class='noindent'>Then, I am not ashamed to confess, I felt suddenly
frightened, for I knew that the mighty heart was beating,
the houses which seemed asleep were full of people peering
into the darkness of the street as I peered through the
darkness at their windows. The street was full; at any
moment I might trample on the unseen; and the unseen
that watched and listened for my faint footsteps might
spring out on me. I walked on tiptoe .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and could
have sworn that some one or something laughed at my
futile caution.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At an unattainable distance, a haze of dirty-lemon
light smeared the darkness. I hurried forward six paces
and bruised my knees against a lamp-post. Pausing to
pick up my hat, I saw a knot of motionless bodies tangled
on the doorstep at my feet. There was no word, no more
laughter; perhaps I had imagined that earlier laugh. The
fog insulated me again as though I had been thrust under
an airless bell-glass with a pile of dead. I dared not
move for fear of treading on one of them. The lemon
light grew dim, as a thicker wave of fog floated silently
from the unplumbed reservoir in the park. I felt my
fingers tightening round my stick. Then one of the
crumpled bodies moved in its sleep and broke the spell.
I walked on—slowly, because I was out of breath—and
steadied my nerves by speaking to the policeman on
duty at the corner.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He too, I found, was insulated by the fog. Some one
should have relieved him hours ago; but every man in the
force was required to regulate the traffic and to shepherd
the hunger-marchers. What had happened to them he
could not tell me. Whenever the fog lifted, he saw groups
of them drifting aimlessly about or camping wearily in
the first resting-place that they could find. As armies,
they had either ceased to exist or had transferred themselves
to another part of London. I asked whether he
had heard of any trouble.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Haven’t heard nothing, sir,” he answered. “Wish
I had. No, there won’t be no trouble. These chaps
are too tired; and they’re all of them strange to
London.”</p>

<h3>2</h3>

<p class='pindent'>When I reached the light and warmth of the tube, I
could analyse calmly my curious surrender to panic on
my way up Great Cumberland Place. A London fog, as
I had told Barbara, was no new phenomenon to me; apart
from its dirt, I rather enjoyed one for its mystery and
romance. If the order of interrogation had been reversed,
I should have assured the policeman that I anticipated no
trouble and that the hunger-marchers were too tired, too
ill-acquainted with London to provoke a riot. I believed
every word that I had said to my wife; I am not more
nervous than most short-sighted and unadventurous men
of forty; and yet for a moment I had entirely lost my
head. Was this due to Barbara’s sudden collapse? Were
my own nerves cracking?</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the familiar long car, staring up at the well-known
advertisements, I was myself again. I could dismiss all
thoughts of imminent death, hanging over the house like
a bird of doom, as lightly as they would have been dismissed
by my stolid neighbours in the train. Barbara,
for some reason, was overexcited. In my uncle’s last
illness she had felt—or said she felt—the presence of
death; she added then, with something of the same terror,
that, if she ever heard my life was in danger, she would
be dragged out of her indifference. We had been talking,
throughout luncheon, of possible riots; I had arrived unexpectedly
because I was anxious for her safety; a cell in
her unconscious mind might well have retained our conversation
as I drove to my uncle’s death-bed. Was it
necessary to probe deeper than that?</p>

<p class='pindent'>What mattered, what I could not yet begin to realize
was that Barbara and I were at last one flesh and spirit.
When I returned to her .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I wondered whether I had done wisely in leaving her.
When I remembered the last poignant attitude in which
I had seen her, kneeling upright with closed eyes and
praying distractedly, I felt unforgivably callous.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“For a casual promise to a friend,” I told myself indignantly;
“when I’ve assured her he’s in no danger
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>As the train ran in to Oxford Circus, I rose from my
seat. Then I sat down again; rose again; sat down again
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. till the conductor called sharply:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now, make up your mind, sir.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I made up my mind and went on to Chancery Lane. I
must keep my word to O’Rane. Had I wished to break
it, I could not; and, with this sense of impotence, something
of my old anxiety returned. Raney would not
have summoned me for a trifle; if he needed me, there
was danger; yet I had told Barbara that I should be as
safe with him as if I stayed in Seymour Street.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class='pindent'>From Chancery Lane I stumbled to my office at a pace
that left no time for morbid fancies. O’Rane was in my
room, sitting by the fire and slapping a stick lazily against
his boot. I have never seen any one less like a figure of
destiny, urging me to an unknown doom. At the vaguest
hint, he would have insisted on my going back to Barbara.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is there any more news?,” I asked. “I came as soon
as I could.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s very good of you. No, I’ve heard nothing since
that first rumour,” he answered. “If I had, I wouldn’t
have bothered you; but I’ve been trying for two hours to
get through to my secretary, and the girl at the exchange
tells me every time that there’s no answer. I expect the
hunger-march has disorganized everything; and I can
smell a pretty thick fog even if I can’t see it.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Shall
we start, or is there anything you want to do here first?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>As we set out, I realized that in the darkness of night
or the greater darkness of a fog the blind man has an
advantage over those who are guided by their eyes. With
a murmured “Chancery Lane Tube; and then change at
Tottenham Court Road”, O’Rane piloted me more surely
and far more quickly than I could have found my way
unaided. The contents-bills outside the station proclaimed—rather
superfluously—“<span class='it'>Fog-Pall over London</span>”;
but, beyond one or two collisions and an accident
with a runaway horse on the Embankment, I could find
no news. “<span class='it'>Griffiths’ Armies</span>” were given a headline of
no more than medium size; and their progress had been
followed less far than Philip Hornbeck had carried it
that morning. The peaceful encounter with the police in
Regent’s Park was briefly described; but of the barricades
which Sonia had seen at Westminster there was no mention.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“By the way, you know Griffiths has turned up
again?,” I said. “Your wife was lunching with us; and
I gathered that he’d called on you at The Sanctuary.
That was just before lunch.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What’s happened to him?,” O’Rane asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sonia told him you weren’t at home.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Did she send him to the office?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I believe she did.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>O’Rane’s face grew grave; but he only muttered a hope
that he would be in time to meet the deputation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This is a moment for desperate remedies,” he explained.
“That’s why I came to see you in the first place.
Most of these fellows will starve, and a fair number will
go berserk if we don’t do something for them. I’ve had
leave to turn Millbank Gardens into a canteen; so we can
look after any one who comes to The Sanctuary. Only a
few, though, will penetrate into the heart of London; the
main armies are still in the suburbs; and if we can set up
relief-camps at Wimbledon, Hounslow, Hampstead, Epping
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I wanted you to help me with the plans .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
Are we nearly there yet?,” he enquired with sudden impatience.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s the next station,” I answered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On the high ground of Hampstead, the fog lay whiter,
with a tantalizing promise that it would clear at any moment.
As we came out of the lift, I could read without
difficulty the shop-signs on the opposite side of the street,
though the higher ground of the Heath alternated patches
of afternoon light with pockets of mist as impenetrable
as anything I had seen at the Marble Arch. Of hunger-marchers
I could find no trace; but here, as everywhere in
London, the police seemed to have been multiplied a hundredfold.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Take my arm,” O’Rane ordered. “I can shew you a
short cut.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Leaving the main road, I followed him through devious
alleys until a sense of open spaces hinted that we must be
near the Heath. After the noise of the train, the silence
of these empty lanes was unearthly; after the thronged
street by the station, we seemed to be alone in the world.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This reminds me of a raid-night in the war,” I said,
as we plunged into a belt of fog. “Pitch-dark. Deserted.
And all the time you feel there are thousands of
people within touching-distance of you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Before he could answer, we had come again into a
broad street and were within touching-distance of a crowd
that seemed to number thousands, though I could only
see the first three or four ranks.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is this one of the armies?,” O’Rane asked, as he
turned, almost without checking, down a footway between
two villas.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Spectators, I think. It was more like a football
crowd than a demonstration.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What the devil’s a crowd doing here?,” he asked
with the first note of anxiety that I had heard in his voice.
“There’s nothing to see, except my office.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Hold
on a minute while I find the key. I’m going to take you
in the back way.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>As we halted, I observed that the footway had brought
us to a high brick wall with a wooden door in the middle.
O’Rane was fitting the key into the lock when the door
opened from the inside and a constable flashed his bull’s-eye
into our faces.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now then, what are you up to?,” he demanded truculently.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This is my office,” O’Rane answered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sorry, sir. My orders are not to let any one in.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But you can’t keep me out of my own house.
Where’s the inspector?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The constable levelled the beam of his lamp on us again,
this time with marked indecision. O’Rane’s voice had a
ring of authority; and the key which he held was superficial
evidence of good faith.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Are you Mr. O’Rane, sir?,” asked the constable.
“The inspector’s been trying to get hold of you. Maybe
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. you haven’t heard, sir?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Haven’t heard what?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The place has been smashed about, sir. Them hunger-marchers .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Any one hurt?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“None of your people, sir; but we had to take our
truncheons to the others. If you’ll see the inspector,
sir .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>O’Rane bent his head and passed through the doorway,
dragging me behind him by the wrist. Our path lay
through an overgrown clump of evergreens; and, when
we came into the open, on a strip of blighted lawn, it
was my turn to catch O’Rane’s wrist while I surveyed
the damage. So far as I could see in the uncertain light,
there was not one whole pane of glass in the place; a
door, torn from its hinges, lay athwart one of the trampled
flower-beds; and under the boarding of the penthouse
that did duty for a waiting-room there trickled a
thin stream of black water. The lawn was carpeted with
files and ledgers; the doorways were blocked with broken
chairs; and the air was heavy with the smell of wet
ashes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The place is wrecked?,” O’Rane broke in on my description.
“That’s enough for the present. Find me
the man in charge.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>In a corner of the main office we came upon a group of
three constables, one inspector and two unexplained men
in plain-clothes. They were talking in undertones round
a table on which O’Rane’s secretary lay in a dead faint.
Another clerk, white-faced and tremulous, sat in another
corner with a telephone; a third wandered distractedly
about the room, tidying books into place and sobbing
gently to herself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This is Mr. O’Rane,” I told the inspector. “We
understand no one’s been killed. That’s all we know.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s not the fault of those others that some one <span class='it'>wasn’t</span>
killed. Excuse me, sir, she’s coming to,” he added in
an undertone. “Don’t hurry her! Stand back there and
give her room.”</p>

<h3>3</h3>

<p class='pindent'>Five minutes later we began to build up a composite
explanation from the inspector’s report and the evidence
of the three eye-witnesses. Shortly after one o’clock a
man had called to see Mr. O’Rane; he gave no name, but
said that he had been sent to the office from Westminster.
On hearing that Mr. O’Rane was not yet arrived, he explained
that he was spokesman of a deputation and would
like to wait for an interview. The one clerk who was on
duty during the luncheon-hour then tried to make an appointment
for the next morning on the ground that Mr.
O’Rane had said he would not be at the office until late,
if indeed he came at all that day. The spokesman of the
deputation replied that he had heard that story before
and enquired sarcastically if he should lead his men back
to Westminster.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He said he’d come all the way from the north,” interposed
O’Rane’s secretary. “I guessed then he was
one of the hunger-marchers; and I .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. didn’t like the
way he spoke. So, when he turned to call the others, I
gave him a push and slammed the door behind him.
Then .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. then .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. then .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>O’Rane patted the girl’s hand while the inspector resumed
his narrative. Barred from one entrance, the
rioters attacked the other and succeeded in wrenching the
door down. Inside, their conduct at first was orderly:
some stretched themselves on the floor, others collected
round the fires; when the police arrived, however, one or
two got out of hand: tables were overturned, drawers ransacked
and the safe bombarded, ineffectually enough, with
sticks and stones. Then two arrests were made; and the
crowd settled down to fight in earnest. Those who were
outside shattered the windows with every missile that
came to hand; those within overturned the furniture,
flung the books from their shelves and kicked burning
coals into the midst of the wreckage. When the truncheons
came into place, the attack collapsed; but, with half-a-dozen
exceptions, the invaders had made good their
escape.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Which way did they go?,” asked O’Rane.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Every way, sir, as far as we could see. They were
lost in the fog before they were out of the garden.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I understand. Well, they’re not likely to come back,
but I suppose you’ll leave some one to look after the
place. I shall be here first thing to-morrow morning, but
I’ve rather a lot to do now. Can you arrange for some
one to take these ladies home? I don’t like them to
wander about unprotected. George, I want you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>As I followed him into the ruins of his private office,
he asked me if Sonia had mentioned where she was going
that afternoon.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I imagine, to The Sanctuary,” I answered. “She
had tickets for a private view, but I heard her say it was
too dark to do anything except go to bed.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And the best place too. Will you get hold of the
other telephone and tell her to bar the door and put the
shutters up in the library? All the ground-floor rooms
without shutters must be locked on the outside. She’s
not to go to the door on any pretext; and there must be
no lights in any window. If I want to get in, I’ll use
the fire-escape; so she must leave the nursery-window
open. Tell her—without frightening her, if possible—that
I’m asking the police to draft some additional men
into the neighbourhood .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You think this gang has gone back?,” I interrupted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This was the first time that I had engaged in any adventure
with O’Rane; and I began to appreciate some of
his qualities of leadership. Always knowing what he
wanted, he made his followers want it with equal intensity;
fearless himself, he subdued fear in others. I
felt that he would stand back to back with me against
an army corps; and it was only natural that I should wish
to stand back to back with him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s more than likely. They’re out for blood now
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. thanks to Sonia’s damned folly in sending them
here when I told her I shouldn’t be near the place. I
should want somebody’s blood myself if I’d had a trick
like that played on me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I sent O’Rane’s message in his own words, not caring
greatly whether I frightened Sonia so long as she obeyed
to the letter. Then I telephoned to Seymour Street to
give a similar warning. I would not speak to Barbara
for fear she should try to argue; but I instructed Robson
to put the house in preparation for a siege. Griffiths had
honoured me with one call; in his mind I was intimately
associated with O’Rane; I did not want him to call a
second time until I had prepared a suitable reception for
him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tell her ladyship that there’s a certain amount of
rioting,” I said, “and it is my urgent wish that she shall
not go out of doors. Mr. O’Rane’s office has been damaged,
though—fortunately—no one has been injured.
I’m going with him to his house in Westminster, just to
see that everything’s all right there. Then I shall come
straight home.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>As I finished speaking, O’Rane came into the room and
asked if I had sent his message.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then I needn’t keep you, old man,” he added. “It
was good of you to see me through. One’s sometimes
extraordinarily helpless without one’s eyes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m coming back with you,” I said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Because .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. one is sometimes extraordinarily helpless
without one’s eyes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But this isn’t your show. Sonia set the match to
the fire; and I must put it out.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I may be able to lend a hand.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>O’Rane stood silent for a moment. Then he shook
his head and turned to the door:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m not going to let you in for this. You have .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
other responsibilities.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s as bad as that?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It may be. You’ve never seen a mob out of temper.”
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If you’re right, I may see one to-day. I’m not going
to let you go alone, Raney.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. good of you; but I think you’re a fool.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, that’s as may be,” I answered. “Come on.”</p>

<h3>4</h3>

<p class='pindent'>As we hurried to the station, I told O’Rane that the
approaches to Westminster had been barricaded earlier in
the day and suggested that we should make for The Sanctuary
by way of Waterloo and Lambeth. He nodded
without speaking; and, after that, I left him undisturbed.
I am not, I never have been, anything that could be called
“a man of action”; I did not know whether we were
hastening into the vortex of a revolution; and, if I had
known, I should have had no idea what to do.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m simply waiting for your orders,” I reminded him,
as we struggled out of the lift.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And I’m waiting for you to tell me what’s happening.
How’s the fog?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I really believe it’s thicker than ever.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good. Take my arm and come for all you’re worth.
There’s no difference to me between night and day or fog
and sunshine; but there’s all the difference in the world
to these other fellows. I figure out that Griffiths’ gang
ought to be arriving just about now, if they’ve come on
foot. And if they’ve come at all. The police ought to
be there before them, with luck. We’ve no idea of numbers
on either side; but one policeman, attacking or defending,
is a match for quite a few people who haven’t
made up their minds how far they want to go. And it’s
a trained against an untrained force. On the other hand,
the police can’t go to extremes until they’re driven.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And in pitch darkness,” I added, “numbers and training
and the majesty of the law don’t count for much.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m banking on that. This may be a one-man show.
Me. The fog’s still holding everywhere? Good again.
We’re all blind for this evening, but I’ve had more than
seven years’ start of the others. I haven’t bumped you
once so far? I can <span class='it'>feel</span> when people are near. And I’m
coming to know London like my own bedroom. There’s
a crossing here, with rather a high kerb. Left incline to
the refuge! There’s a lorry feeling his way along .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
and getting tied up with a south-bound tram. We can
go on now. People aren’t frightened of a fog nearly as
much as I should have expected. When I remember the
agony of fear I went through when I was blinded .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
The helplessness .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Here’s Westminster Bridge, but
I don’t think it’s the least use trying that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>We hurried along the south bank of the river and only
crossed when we were safely in the rear of all possible
pickets.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What happens if we get separated?,” I asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Look after yourself as best you can, but don’t call
me by name. D’you know <span class='it'>Lilliburlero</span>? Well, pretend
you’re Uncle Toby and whistle that when you get a
chance, just to shew me where you are. If you want
help, whistle <span class='it'>John Peel</span>. I’ll get to you if I can .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Of
course, we <span class='it'>may</span> find everything as peaceful as the grave.
If we do, I think I shall still take the precaution of moving
Sonia and the boys to some other part of London.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Bring them to Seymour Street,” I suggested.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I will, thankfully. If we find there’s a scrap in progress,
we must arrange a retreat. There’ll be nobody on
the west side of the house, because there are no windows
for any one to break on the ground floor; and there’s a
fairly high wall round the stable-yard. If you’ll keep
<span class='it'>cavé</span>, I’ll slip in there and go up the fire-escape. I’ll
give you the first line of <span class='it'>The Campbells Are Coming</span> to
know if the coast’s clear; if you’ll reply with <span class='it'>Over the
Hills and Far Away</span>, I shall know I can unlock the door.
From there, the way is by Smith Square, Great College
Street and Dean’s Yard. The gates will be shut against
us; but the police will open them.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Are you feeling
at all nervous?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A bit keyed-up. This damned fog .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You may live to bless it. If for any reason we don’t
both get through, we’ll say good-bye now. Slow down a
bit; we can’t be more than fifty yards from the corner.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Though I fancied we were still half a mile away, I
discovered—by the abrupt change from stucco to brick—that
we had indeed reached the south side of the house.
So far as I could see or hear, the neighbourhood was deserted;
but a single distant thud, followed by a sharp
tinkle, told me that some one on the other side of the
house had broken a window and that the missile had
been stopped by a shutter. I heard hurried footsteps and
pulled up within an inch of colliding with a young policeman.
His truncheon was drawn; and he had lost his
helmet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You gentlemen had best keep out of this,” he
warned us.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What’s happening?,” I asked. “Are these the hunger-marchers?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I reckon so. And they’re out for mischief. If you
could see them, it wouldn’t be so bad .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He broke off as a fusillade of stones rattled against the
house. A hollow ‘plump’, like the sound of a weight
dropped into water, indicated another broken window;
and in the moment’s silence that followed we heard another
tinkle of glass.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The house will stand a good deal of that,” O’Rane
murmured. “They’ve had no luck with the door?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Two or three got in by the area window,” stated the
constable. “Now they can’t get out again. There are
two men waiting for them.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>O’Rane broke into an unexpected laugh:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m afraid they’ll have a long wait. That’s the cellar;
and the door’s sure to be locked. I hope they’ll find the
wine to their taste.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is this your house, sir?,” asked the policeman.
“You’d best not let them see you, then. They’re after
you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So it seems,” O’Rane answered, as a new volley of
stones rattled on to the pavement and a series of short
scuffles gave place to the sound of running feet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The battle, we were told, had been raging for half-an-hour.
At first the assailants had concentrated on the
front door; when that refused to yield, they began to
break every window within reach until the police scattered
them. Then the attack was transferred to a distance.
On the Embankment twenty yards away, where
the road was under repair, lay miscellaneous heaps of
stones and granite blocks. By these the hunger-marchers
collected and bombarded both the house and the newly
formed cordon. It was a difficult attack to meet at any
time, but the fog made it impossible. When the police
charged, the assailants slipped between and round them,
to reassemble in flank and to continue their bombardment
of the house at close-quarters; when the police charged
back, the hunger-marchers returned to their ammunition-dump
and reopened a long-range fire. The present lull
in the fighting was due to a change of tactics: half the
police were stationed in open order round the house, while
the other half encircled the granite piles to cut off supplies.
Their numbers, however, were insufficient to hold
either position effectively; and, though further reinforcements
were reported to be on their way, there were enough
stones lying loose about the house for a long spell of irregular
practice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is that fellow Griffiths in charge?,” asked O’Rane.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve heard so,” answered the constable.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I want to get hold of him. This must be stopped,
but it’s no good breaking heads and putting people under
arrest. We must stop it before the reinforcements come
up and the whole thing starts again. There’s a lot to be
said for these fellows: they’re hungry, to begin with, and
they’ve been fooled by everybody, Griffiths most of all.
The first thing they need is a meal; and I’m going to
promise them that, if they’ll stop this stone-throwing business.
And after that we must find ’em a place for the
night; but I must promise them there’ll be no arrests.
Where’s the inspector?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He’s guarding the area window, sir.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I hope to God I can make my voice heard,” O’Rane
muttered, as he vanished from my side to be swallowed
up in the fog.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I waited with the constable because I had been given
no orders. He had been on duty for little more than
half-an-hour and could tell me nothing of the battle’s beginning.
On the other hand, he told me much about
the rest of London: my premonition of a duel between
Griffiths and the O’Ranes had come true; in every other
part, the hunger-marchers were being peacefully conducted
to makeshift kitchens and dormitories; Hampstead
was quiet again; and this brawl, between unknown
numbers on either side, was the nearest approach—as
Philip Hornbeck might have said—to barricade-fighting.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Only a brawl, but an unpleasant brawl. I do not remember
feeling unusually frightened, though I was more
than usually helpless. From time to time a stone hurtled
over my head or skated along the pavement at my feet;
of all futile precautions, I pulled my hat over my eyes
and turned up my coat-collar; also, I heard a sustained
cursing of this Egyptian darkness and was surprised to
recognize my own voice behind it. I could not see my
watch; I have no idea how long it was before the next
fusillade was followed by the now inevitable scuffling
rush. Then came the sound of O’Rane’s voice from the
front of the house. He called several times for Griffiths;
and, when no answer came, he began to talk to the crowd
and at their leader in the same breath.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Only once before had I heard O’Rane address a mass-meeting:
that was in the early days of the war, when he
came to gather recruits and wagered light-heartedly that
he would stampede the meeting in five minutes. He won
his bet; but then he had been able to see his audience, and
his audience yielded to the double hypnotism of his voice
and eyes. Now he was talking to a blind tent of darkness.
I could not watch the effect; I could not tell how
many heard him nor how many were present to hear. It
was something that they listened in silence; but, until the
speech was over, neither he nor I could tell for certain
whether any one was in earshot.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was little more in what he said now than in what
he had rehearsed to me. After telling the crowd his
name—which was received in silence—, he explained
that, when the deputation called earlier in the day and at
the moment when it was marching on his office in Hampstead,
he had been taking steps to procure food for men
whose only fault at that time was that they had listened
to promises which could not be kept. If they did not
know that, Griffiths did; the government had stated a
dozen times that it would not receive their leaders; and
the sympathy which the hunger-marchers had aroused on
their way to London would vanish in a moment if they
destroyed houses and helped themselves to private property.
Though it was too late to undo the harm already
done, it could be overlooked. If the rioting stopped instantly,
no steps would be taken against the rioters, with
the exception of Griffiths himself, against whom the police
already held a warrant for inciting to crime. Further,
immediate steps would be taken to provide shelter and
food; but the stone-throwing must stop. Those who
came forward empty-handed would be marshalled and
led to Millbank Gardens, where supplies had already been
collected.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The speech was over in three minutes; but twice that
time passed before any answer came. I moved round to
the front of the house, but the place from which O’Rane’s
voice had issued was occupied by a single policeman.
There was no more stone-throwing, but I could see nothing
of the besieging army. Once I whistled a few bars of
<span class='it'>Lilliburlero</span>, but they passed unacknowledged. Then I
walked in a wider compass towards the battlefield on the
Embankment. Everything was silent, every one was still;
and each man suspected his neighbour. I could see
neither policemen nor rioters until I was within a yard
of them; then a face would leap at me out of the grey
fog. Usually it was frightened, sometimes it was angry;
always it seemed thin, hopeless and bewildered. The
stench was oppressive; the sense of silent numbers suffocating.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As I turned back towards the house, I felt a slight
tremor among the men who surrounded me. Perhaps my
own aimless movement had given them the lead they were
awaiting. Those ahead of us were pushed forward; those
behind hurried to catch up. Suspicion seemed to die
down; and I heard a hoarse murmur of conversation.
Finding myself alone, I tried <span class='it'>Lilliburlero</span> again; and
with an answering whistle O’Rane slipped like a snake
through the intervening ranks and stationed himself at
my side.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You all right?,” he whispered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, thanks. It’s over, Raney. What d’you want
me to do now?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let’s be sure first that it <span class='it'>is</span> over.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I don’t like
the sound of <span class='it'>that</span>.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Taking my arm, he led me in the direction of a voice
that seemed to be answering his own speech. I could
not hear the words; and, if I suspected the voice to be
Griffiths’, that was only because a curious snarl, passed
from lip to lip, was taken up as a cry.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They’re saying it’s a trap,” I told O’Rane.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Trap .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Trap .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Trap .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.” came the snarl;
and those who were nearest the house turned headlong
till we were almost swept off our feet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Trap be damned,” shouted a voice; and in place of
the mutters and snarls came the roar of two opposing
armies.</p>

<h3>5</h3>

<p class='pindent'>It was very much as I had foreseen; very much as I
had predicted to Griffiths himself. His men were turning
against him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When hunger first became unbearable, they soothed
their anger with a dose of wholesale destruction. If Griffiths
had not urged them to it, I have never heard any
one suggest that he tried to restrain them; I should be
sceptical if any one told me that he had marched them
from Hampstead to Westminster with another thought
than to offer them a further dose of the same sedative.
By this time, however, the men were realizing that broken
windows brought satisfaction to no one but the fortunate
two or three who had dug themselves into the wine-cellar.
I hoped they would remain there. In a lull between
two bursts of shouting I heard a subterranean bellowing;
one or two bottles were flung up and promptly
smashed by the inspector of police. I did not want our
complications to be increased by the madness that comes
to starving men who have inflamed their aching stomachs
with strong liquor. O’Rane, if he aimed at dividing the
enemy, could not have chosen a happier moment for exposing
Griffiths to his followers. Their resentment of
that day’s leadership became lost in a greater resentment
of the leadership that had dragged them to London. Fear
sharpened the antagonism of those who had heard a moment
before that they were being incited by Griffiths to
crime; the police were still very near; and O’Rane had
promised an amnesty to all who threw down their missiles
and came forward peacefully.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Amnesty and immediate food. The collective cry of
hunger was less than human; but, as I had predicted, the
disappointed mob had vengeance to wreak on the author
of its misfortunes before it could eat in comfort of mind.
As though a barrier had fallen, there was a rush towards
the corner of the street where an excited voice could still
be heard haranguing of ‘traps’.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That fellow will be lynched if we don’t get him
away!,” O’Rane cried.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’ll be lynched yourself,” I answered, “if you get
mixed up with his gang.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Even as I spoke, the tide hung and turned. As I
might have foreseen, as Griffiths himself had told me, he
could look after himself. Again I could not hear his
words; for part of the time I fancy he was speaking in
Welsh; and he held his audience. The opposing clamour
dwindled and died away. The hoarse cheers of his supporters
spread until they were taken up all round us.
There was a pause of perfect stillness, like the moment
when a gigantic wave gathers before breaking; then the
mob turned as one man upon the house.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Griffiths had won that round.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I imagine this must be something like the storming
of the Bastille,” O’Rane murmured coolly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They’re absolutely out of hand. The police are using
their truncheons, too,” I added, as the sickening smack
of hard wood on human flesh and bone was followed by
yelps of rage and whimpering moans.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I haven’t heard anything of our precious reinforcement
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. There’s a most awful reek of whisky.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They’re looting the cellar. Once <span class='it'>that</span> begins .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If they’ll get drunk quietly, it will be the best thing
in the world for everybody.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. D’you smell burning?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I sniffed; but my duller senses told me nothing till I
saw a distant orange glow fainter than the reflection of a
winter sunset.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They’ve started a fire. I can’t see where.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is it making any difference to the fog?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, but I believe the fog’s lifting. I can see .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
oh, ten yards. Come out of the way: I think the police
are going to charge again.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Though I dragged at his arm, O’Rane stayed motionless.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If the fog’s lifting .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.,” he murmured slowly.
Then, for the second time that evening, he gripped my
hand. “We must go while the going’s good. The
stable-door. And afterwards by Smith Square and Great
College Street.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I found myself suddenly alone. The fog was certainly
lifting, for I could see the concerted rush of the police,
though I was not in time to get out of their way. It was
a truncheon, I think, and not a stray stone that brought
me down. I remember excruciating pain at the side of
my head; I remember my knees giving slowly beneath
me; and then, for a time, I remember nothing more.</p>

<h3>6</h3>

<p class='pindent'>When I came to, the fire was invisible; but the battle
was still raging. My glasses were gone; my head ached
savagely; and an ungentle foot had trodden my left hand
to a bleeding pulp. I felt overpoweringly sick; and I
wanted to crawl away from all this din till I had recovered
my nerve. I did not know why I was there at all.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then I remembered O’Rane and the stable-door.</p>

<p class='pindent'>During the war, I was told by many of my friends
that, in the first moments after being slightly wounded,
they became wholly demoralized: they might have been
facing intensive fire for several hours on end without
undue discomfort, but, when once they had been hit, they
dodged and cowered their way back to the clearing-station
as though the heavens were raining shrapnel upon them.
My own demoralization, as I slunk away and made for
the stable-door by the other side of the house, was more
complete than I care to remember: I ducked, I sidestepped,
I ran, I hid, everywhere pursued by the reek and
roar of struggling humanity, convinced against all reason
that I alone was visible in the darkness and that every
missile was deliberately aimed at me.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The stable-door was locked; I could see no one near
it; and I sank to the ground till I should faint again or
be trampled to death. There was some challenge, some
pass-word for me to remember; but, when I heard a whistle,
I forgot my orders and called out: “Here I am! All
clear.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was a precautionary pause before the door was
opened. Then O’Rane pushed a small, muffled figure
towards me and stepped into the road with a second
figure, slightly larger and equally muffled, in his arms.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Shut the door quietly and follow me,” he whispered.
“It locks itself.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where’s Sonia?,” I asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I must go back for her. She’s rather rattled.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I cannot say whether my recovery was the natural result
of time or whether I was infected by O’Rane’s unruffled
calm. His companionship meant much; his air of
authority more; and, if I was still frightened, I hope at
least that I did not shew it. A very few steps, moreover,
brought us into comparative quiet; and I could forget the
red-hot pain in my head.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The fog <span class='it'>is</span> lifting,” I told O’Rane.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The deuce it is!” He stopped suddenly and lowered
his burden to the ground. “You must take Daniel as
well, while I go back. Sonia wouldn’t face the fire-escape;
and I must carry her down. There’s no time to
lose, because these fellows have been filling up on neat
spirit; and I came across a dud incendiary-bomb .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
which doesn’t look like clean fighting. You’re in Smith
Square now. Feel your way round the church railings,
then straight ahead, then to the left as far as you can go.
Knock up any of the Abbey people and say these children
must be taken in. Give them <span class='it'>your</span> address and beat it for
home. We shall join you as soon as we can. Go carefully,”
he added in a whisper. “There’s some one coming.
Oh, it’s only a woman. <span class='it'>She</span> won’t hurt you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>As he turned back to The Sanctuary, I gave Daniel my
undamaged hand while I hoisted little David half on to
my shoulder. I had heard no footsteps, but somewhere
in this bewildering darkness I heard a woman’s light
cough. Then a voice said:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t look round! I’ll take the baby as soon as we’re
safe, but I want to keep my hands free just in case .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then we came into a narrow circle of lamp-light and
I saw Barbara in tweed jacket and trousers. She had
tidied her hair away under one of my hats; and the fingers
of her right hand gripped a service revolver.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“When you didn’t come .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.” she began.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’ve no right to be here,” I exclaimed in horror.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Just as much right as you, darling. I drove the car
here in case any one was .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. hurt. It’s in that street
by the Church House.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then will you shew me the way and take these infants
to Seymour Street? Raney will follow as soon as he can
bring Sonia down.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m going back to give him a hand.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Must you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There may be other people in the house. Servants.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Barbara lifted the child off my shoulders into her arms
and hurried down a side street. The fog was lifting rapidly,
too rapidly; I could see across the street and I wondered
how much could be seen on the battlefield outside
The Sanctuary.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If you <span class='it'>must</span> .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.” Barbara murmured. “George, I
told Robson I was coming to see if I could help you;
but .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I brought the car to take back your dead body.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve no intention of being killed,” I said, “but we
can’t leave people to be burnt alive.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. take the revolver,” said Barbara helplessly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When we had put the children inside the car, I went
back at a run down Great College Street to Smith Square.
The fog lay in pockets so that I could see thirty yards
at one moment and less than three at another. I fancied,
as I neared The Sanctuary, that the noise had diminished;
I could see neither fire nor smoke; and, though my own
road was deserted, I thought I could hear the patter of
running feet. It was more than time for the reinforcements
to have arrived; it was more than a likelihood
that, with the increasing light, experience and discipline
were favouring the police. I was halfway through Smith
Square when I heard a sound of crying and saw a woman’s
figure cowering against the railings. As I went forward,
I was greeted with a scream of terror; the figure
turned to run, and I recognized Sonia.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Calling her by name, I started in pursuit and brought
her back from the scene of riot for which she was blindly
heading. Her nerve was gone; and I had dragged and
carried her halfway to the car before she could speak
coherently. Then I learned that the battle was over, the
fire out and Griffiths’ army in full flight; but all this
was nothing to the unforgettable agony of the bombardment,
and she sobbed hysterically as she tried to describe
her own sufferings from the moment when she received
my message from Hampstead to the moment when her
husband climbed through the nursery-window.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where <span class='it'>is</span> Raney?,” I asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He’s following. He said it was dangerous for us to
go together; and I should get along quicker without him.
Oh, George, it was so awful! I believe I’m going to
faint.” .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Though I tried to comfort her, I should have had an
easier task if she had composed herself wholly or wholly
collapsed. Though I had not shared her ordeal, I felt
that Sonia was making rather a pitiful exhibition of herself.
She was frightened, but so was I; so—under his
Gasconnade—was O’Rane; so—without disguise—had
Barbara been. When, however, an emergency
wrested the direction of her daily life from her own
hands, Barbara behaved as tradition and inherited instinct
taught her. Though her body might play her false, the
dauntless strength of breeding came out in her spirit;
she might break down in private; but, once on the public
scaffold, she shewed an Elizabethan daring and feared
death less than the ague which might make her enemies
think she feared death. Alone of us four, Sonia was
more concerned for her personal alarms than for the dignity
of the order in which we had been brought up.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s only a few yards to the car,” I told her. “Barbara
will look after you. And you’ll find the children
quite safe.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. D’you know which way David was
coming?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I just ran for my life. He said he’d follow.”
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I handed her over to my wife’s keeping with no more
comment than that she was badly shaken in nerve. There
might have been a noticeable contraction of sympathy if
Barbara, who had superfluously ventured into this maelstrom
through loyalty to me, heard that Sonia had run
for her life and left her blind husband to extricate herself
from the danger in which she had involved him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m just going to meet Raney,” I said. “He’s expecting
us either in Dean’s Yard or Seymour Street.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If we’ve gone before you come back, it’ll mean that
he’s found us first,” said Barbara. “Then you’ll come
home independently. Take care of yourself.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s all over now. Even the fog’s almost gone.”</p>

<h3>7</h3>

<p class='pindent'>As I returned to The Sanctuary for the last time, I
could see—even without my glasses—from one lamp-post
to the next. The narrow streets north of Smith
Square were almost empty; and I could hardly blame a
routed enemy for shying from such sinister avenues of
escape. There were more and more people as I drew
nearer to the Embankment, all of them rather dazed and
many wounded. I saw no dead, though stretchers were
being hurried up as I came in sight of The Sanctuary;
and of the battle there was no other sound than a rapid
scurry of feet towards Westminster Bridge and Vauxhall.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At the corner of Sanctuary Road I was challenged
and stopped by a policeman.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m looking for the gentleman whose house has been
attacked,” I explained. “I’ve got his family in a car
near by; but he’s unfortunately blind, and I don’t want
him to miss them.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I was allowed through; and, a moment later, I stood
in the midst of one of the strangest scenes that I have
witnessed. To see, to smell and to touch, it was a blend
of shambles and distillery under the combined influence
of earthquake and fire. The ground was in places waist-deep
with stones; for twenty feet round the house I heard
the glass crackling as I walked. More than once I
slipped in an ominous pool of blood; and the air was
sickly with the smell of whisky and singed clothing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I whistled and called O’Rane’s name, but there was no
answer. Every approach was now guarded by police;
and on either side of the cordon I heard scuffling as the
last unyielding attackers were put under arrest. In the
middle of the open square, the wounded were laid out to
await the ambulances. I borrowed a lantern and flashed
it down the lines, but there was no one remotely resembling
Raney.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m going to try the house now,” I told the policeman
nearest the stables. “If you’ll give me a leg up, I
can get over the wall and up the fire escape.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was no one in the yard, no one in the house.
As a last hope, I interrogated two or three of the constables;
but, if any of them had found time to notice
anything my description did not help to identify one
half-seen figure in a surging crowd of many thousands.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, if he turns up,” I said to the inspector, “will
you tell him that all’s well and that his family has gone
to Mr. Oakleigh’s house?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then, handing him a card, I bent my steps in the direction
of the Church House.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The fog had lifted; and only a faint haze remained.
For the first time in many hours I looked at my watch to
explain what seemed to be stars. It was nine o’clock; and
I became suddenly conscious of great hunger, great fatigue
and almost unbearable pain in my head and hand.
At the same moment I began to see the events of the
afternoon in their perspective.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nothing quite of this kind had happened for a hundred
years. Barbara had confirmed what the policeman told
me: this outbreak was isolated and unique. Within the
next day or two I was to meet men who had driven
unsuspectingly across the battlefield from luncheon-parties
an hour before the battle; I was to meet others who
drove across the same ground an hour after the surrender
and only imagined that the road was under repair. It was
local, it was brief; but it was new. Had I seen the beginning
or the end? Sardou, I remember, makes one of
his characters say: “<span class='it'>An</span> émeute <span class='it'>is when the mob is conquered;
then they are all</span> canaille; <span class='it'>a revolution is when
they are victorious; then they are all heroes</span>.” The <span class='it'>émeute</span>
of to-day, however, becomes not infrequently the revolution
of to-morrow. I felt that, in history, this outbreak
might mark a turning-point: it would be the first active
step towards a social revolution, or it would be the last
demonstration of turbulence before a great and orderly
people, with a genius for self-government, adjusted itself
slowly, pragmatically and irrationally to the new conditions.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I know now, I knew next day, that the collision which
loomed so large to me would escape the notice of the most
vigilant historian. The average headline in the average
paper said no more than: <span class='sc'>Disorderly scenes in westminster.
Feared loss of life.</span> Then and now I
felt and feel that what I witnessed was more than a
“disorderly scene”. Little more than eight years
had passed since the threat of a European war shook
us to the foundations of our being. The ardent
among us had vowed that, if we won, we would have
an order of civilization for which any man would be
proud to die. After eight years, the danger of a new war
lowered more menacingly than in the summer months of
1914. And the civilization which we had set up to commemorate
the war was to be judged on that afternoon’s
encounter. Had the association of one human being with
another, in his national and international grouping, grown
so complex that no one could control it? Had the world
become like the Roman Empire in its last days, when—for
no reason that a statesman of the day or an historian
of later days could enunciate—the mighty machine
ceased to revolve? If the aim of government was to
secure the life and liberty of the governed and to lead
them towards prosperity and happiness, government had
palpably failed in victorious England and France, in defeated
Germany, in revolutionary Russia. My uncle
warned me on his death-bed that we were back in 1914;
had he been with me now, I must have told him that we
were sunk to something incredibly lower than 1914.
After the events of this afternoon I did not believe that
even O’Rane would dispute that.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Of all the ironies that had chequered his life, I knew
of none greater than that his should be the house to be
attacked by the most downtrodden and hopeless section
of the community. If their salvation could have been
helped by his death, he would have given his life for them
as lightly as another man might toss a coin to a beggar.
Now, if any one had indeed been killed, he would be held
indirectly responsible.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I had come to a halt till the pain which every step sent
shooting through my head should abate. Looking again
at my watch, I saw that I must hasten. By Great College
Street, O’Rane had told me, and then into Dean’s Yard.
As I turned the corner, I had to step aside to avoid an
obstacle. Glancing back, I saw that it was a man. He
lay stretched on his back, with his arms flung out, midway
between two lamp-posts; and I could not be sure
whether he was wounded or drunk. I called out to find
if he wanted help; but there was no answer. Then I
struck a match.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As it flared, I saw what—in some way that I shall
never understand—I had been expecting to see. It was
this that had sent me back to his side again and again;
this, maybe, that had brought Barbara with her car; this,
for all I know, that appeared to her in the semblance of
black wings beating a prophetic message over the house.
O’Rane’s hands were cold as ice; the back of his head
was brutally smashed. His black eyes stared up to heaven
in mild perplexity at the insoluble enigma of death and
the eternal paradox of life.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He looked a boy of twenty.</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG&#8482;
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for an eBook, except by following
the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away&#8212;you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected
by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the trademark

To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg&#8482; License available with this file or online at

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>

immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work (any work

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<blockquote>
  <div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions
    whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it under the terms
    of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online
    at <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you

</blockquote>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg&#8482;

with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg&#8482; License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>

Gutenberg&#8482; License.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>

any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.
</div>

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
provided that:
</div>

<div style='margin-left:0.7em;'>
    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &#8226; You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
        within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are

        &#8226; You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies

        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
        all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
        works.
    </div>

    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &#8226; You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of

</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal

PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone

accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
